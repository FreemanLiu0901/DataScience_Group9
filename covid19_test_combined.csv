39772174,Integrating Interpretability in Machine Learning and Deep Neural Networks A Novel Approach to Feature Importance and Outlier Detection in COVID19 Symptomatology and Vaccine Efficacy,In this study we introduce a novel approach that integrates interpretability techniques from both traditional machine learning ML and deep neural networks DNN to quantify feature importance using global and local interpretation methods Our method bridges the gap between interpretable ML models and powerful deep learning DL architectures providing comprehensive insights into the key drivers behind model predictions especially in detecting outliers within medical data We applied this method to analyze COVID19 pandemic data from 2020 yielding intriguing insights We used a dataset consisting of individuals who were tested for COVID19 during the early stages of the pandemic in 2020 The dataset included selfreported symptoms and test results from a wide demographic and our goal was to identify the most important symptoms that could help predict COVID19 infection accurately By applying interpretability techniques to both machine learning and deep learning models we aimed to improve understanding of symptomatology and enhance early detection of COVID19 cases Notably even though less than 1 of our cohort reported having a sore throat this symptom emerged as a significant indicator of active COVID19 infection appearing 7 out of 9 times in the top four most important features across all methodologies This suggests its potential as an early symptom marker Studies have shown that individuals reporting sore throat may have a compromised immune system where antibody generation is not functioning correctly This aligns with our data which indicates that 5 of patients with sore throats required hospitalization Our analysis also revealed a concerning trend of diminished immune response postCOVID infection increasing the likelihood of severe cases requiring hospitalization This finding underscores the importance of monitoring patients postrecovery for potential complications and tailoring medical interventions accordingly Our study also raises critical questions about the efficacy of COVID19 vaccines in individuals presenting with sore throat as a symptom The results suggest that booster shots might be necessary for this population to ensure adequate immunity given the observed immune response patterns The proposed method not only enhances our understanding of COVID19 symptomatology but also demonstrates its broader utility in medical outlier detection This research contributes valuable insights to ongoing efforts in creating interpretable models for COVID19 management and vaccine optimization strategies By leveraging feature importance and interpretability these models empower physicians healthcare workers and researchers to understand complex relationships within medical data facilitating more informed decisionmaking for patient care

40396505,Vaccines for preventing infections in adults with haematological malignancies,Vaccination aims to prevent infections People who are immunocompromised such as those with haematological malignancies often experience higher immunosuppression increasing their vulnerability to infections compared to individuals with solid tumours or healthy individuals The aim of this review is to summarise and evaluate the benefits and risks of vaccines for preventing infections in adults with haematological malignancies We conducted a comprehensive systematic search in CENTRAL MEDLINE Embase LILACS and Web of Science on 2 December 2024 for randomised controlled trials RCTs and for controlled nonrandomised studies of interventions NRSIs We also searched ClinicalTrialsgov WHO World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform ICTRP and the Cochrane COVID19 Study Register We included RCTs and controlled NRSIs evaluating the preventive effect of vaccines on outcomes prioritised by clinical experts patients and patient representatives The prioritised outcomes for adults  18 years with haematological malignancies excluding those receiving cellular therapies were infection incidence allcause mortality quality of life adverse events of any grade serious adverse events and adverse events of special interest We looked for studies that evaluated a broad range of vaccine types eg COVID19 diphtheria Haemophilus influenzae type b hepatitis B herpes zoster influenza Neisseria meningitidis pertussis polio Streptococcus pneumoniae or tetanus but we excluded liveattenuated vaccines We followed current Cochrane methodological standards in the conduct of this review We assessed the risk of bias using the Cochrane risk of bias 2 tool RoB 2 for RCTs and Risk Of Bias In Nonrandomised Studies  of Interventions ROBINSI for controlled NRSIs We included six studies four RCTs two controlled NRSIs with a total of 25886 participants We present the RCT results here and the NRSI findings from NRSIs in the full review We judged one RCT on herpes zoster to be at low risk of bias overall and we had some concerns about bias in the other RCT on herpes zoster We had some concerns about bias in the RCTs on COVID19 and influenza vaccines Herpes zoster vaccines Two RCTs involving 3067 participants with a range of haematological malignancies evaluated vaccines for preventing herpes zoster compared to placebo or no vaccine Vaccines may reduce herpes zoster incidence up to 21 months postvaccination although the 95 CI includes the possibility of no effect 4 versus 6 RR 040 95 CI 007 to 223 2 RCTs 3067 participants lowcertainty evidence Vaccines probably have little to no effect on allcause mortality up to 28 days postvaccination 27 versus 26 RR

adverse events substantially 40 versus 13 RR 307 95 CI 262 to 359 highcertainty evidence and also increase systemic adverse events 10 versus 6 RR 182 95 CI 138 to 240 highcertainty evidence as measured in 2548 participants within 28 days postvaccination Neither RCT reported quality of life COVID19 vaccines One RCT involving 95 participants with lymphoma leukaemia or myeloma evaluated the BNT162b2 COVID19 vaccine compared to placebo or no vaccine Evidence about the effect of BNT162b2 vaccine on the incidence of COVID19 up to six months after the second dose compared to placebo or no vaccine remains very uncertain 22 versus 2 RR 111 95 CI 007 to 1725 1 RCT 95 participants very low certainty evidence Regarding safety data mixed population including both solid tumours and haematological malignancies BNT162b2 vaccine probably increases the number of participants with any grade adverse events 35 versus 175 RR 199 95 CI 171 to 230 1 RCT 2328 participants moderatecertainty evidence and there may be little to no difference concerning the number of participants experiencing serious adverse events 24 versus 17 RR 143 95 CI 080 to 254 1 RCT 2328 participants lowcertainty evidence The RCT did not report allcause mortality quality of life injection site adverse events or systemic adverse events Influenza vaccines No RCTs evaluated an influenza vaccine versus placebo or no vaccine One RCT involving 122 participants with plasma cell disorders evaluated different dosing regimens for an influenza vaccine on the incidence of influenza infection Evidence is very uncertain regarding the effect of two doses of highdose trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine compared to one dose with strength based on age of influenza vaccination on the incidence of infection within the 2015 to 2016 flu season 4 versus 8 RR 049 95 CI 011 to 208 very lowcertainty evidence The RCT did not report allcause mortality quality of life anygrade or serious adverse events or injection site or systemic adverse events The evidence on vaccines for preventing infections in adults with haematological malignancies is limited and uncertain Herpes zoster vaccines may reduce infection risk for up to 21 months but the certainty of the evidence is low While there is a considerable increase in shortterm adverse events highcertainty evidence no increase in serious adverse events was observed at up to 12 months moderatecertainty evidence Data on longterm impacts on other outcomes are lacking For COVID19 and influenza vaccines the evidence is very uncertain We found no studies that could be included in the review of vaccines for our other infectious diseases of interest diphtheria Haemophilus influenzae type b Hib hepatitis B Neisseria meningitidis pertussis polio Streptococcus

40266230,Robust COVID19 Vaccine Responses Despite Filarial CoInfection Insights from a Lymphatic Filariasis Cohort in Ghana,Although the COVID19 pandemic has largely concluded the varied trajectories it has followed in different regions of the world remain incompletely understood Intensive research is needed to fully grasp its course and the implications for future global health challenges Notably the milder trajectory of the COVID19 pandemic in SubSaharan Africa has defied initial predictions An emerging body of evidence suggests that in addition to the continents younger average age and the lower prevalence of relevant comorbidities coinfections with helminths may have also impressively shaped the pandemics milder trajectory in the region Indeed helminths are renowned for their ability to modulate human immune responses which while potentially beneficial in limiting excessive inflammation could also diminish vaccine efficacy and impede viral clearance This study investigated different aspects of the intricate interactions between COVID19 and Lymphatic Filariasis LF a helminth infection caused by parasitic worms such as Wuchereria bancrofti Brugia malayi and Brugia timori and endemic to various regions in SubSaharan Africa and the tropics For this purpose samples of a larger and ongoing clinical trial ethical approval codes CHRPEAP52517 and 32521 trial registration number ISRCTN14042737 were collected from 222 individuals from endemic areas of Ghana along with comprehensive clinical and demographic data The samples include LF patients n  222 grouped according to their Lymphoedema LE stages as well as COVID19 vaccinated n  81 and nonvaccinated individuals n  141 All vaccinated participants received the COVID19 vaccine ChAdOx1S also known as Vaxzevria developed by the University of Oxford and AstraZenca The expressions of SARSCoV2 and filarialspecific antibodies IgG IgA were accessed using ELISA while Luminexbased immunoassays were employed to measure the expression of SARSCoV2 variantspecific neutralizing antibodies The interplay between vaccine responses and demographic factors was analyzed using group comparisons with the KruskalWallis or MannWhitney U tests The results indicate that a remarkable portion of unvaccinated individuals 56 IgA seropositive 39 IgG seropositive developed antibodies against SARSCoV2 despite no confirmed infection Notably the study identified a robust antibody response to COVID19 vaccination which was independent of the degree of LF pathology or parasitic status An important observation was the reduced SARSCoV2 antibody response in individuals seropositive for Ascaris lumbricoides p  00264 highlighting an interaction between roundworm infection and COVID19 The study concludes that the ChAdOx1S COVID19 vaccine AstraZeneca triggers a strong immune response in LF patients however filarial andor soiltransmitted helminth seropositivity might influence the COVID19 infectioninduced

to postpartum family planning in Amhara Ethiopia a qualitative study,Poor mental health can negatively impact health outcomes across diverse health areas including in the first year postpartum Yet the intersection of postpartum mental health and postpartum family planning FP is understudied Cognitive Behavioral Therapy CBT is an evidencebased practice that has proven helpful for improving mental health and supporting positive behavior change across health areas including in lowresource settings Drawing on existing CBT tools we created and piloted an intervention called Mothers Time designed to be delivered in three sessions by a community health worker CHW to small groups of postpartum women experiencing depression or anxiety symptoms and an unmet need for FP Our objective was to assess the feasibility and acceptability of Mothers Time in rural Amhara Ethiopia We recruited and trained four CHWs to deliver the intervention We recruited 16 postpartum women experiencing mild to moderate anxiety and depressive symptoms to participate We conducted indepth interviews with women and CHWs before during and after the intervention We used a framework approach to analyze data To assess acceptability we analyzed data from mothers probing to understand whether they found the intervention accessible engaging and relevant for the challenges they were experiencing postpartum To assess feasibility we explored CHWs ability to deliver the intervention and analyzed their capacity to deliver it at consistent quality Interviews with CHWs and other health actors provided additional data on the feasibility of adding simplified CBT to CHWs current package of services Mothers perceived Mothers Time to be acceptable and to provide helpful tools for navigating the postpartum period Prior to the intervention many women felt isolated and the group sessions supported social connection Vignettes demonstrating simple CBT concepts engaged mothers provoking reflection on how anxious or sad thoughts can impact behaviors that are important for informed FP use such as care seeking spousal communication and planning for the future and sparked discussions on how mothers can support their own mental and physical health Homework explained by CHW in sessions and completed independently between sessions helped women prioritize caring for themselves and social connection Overall we found that it was feasible for CHW to learn and deliver Mothers Time CHW understood that mental health could create challenges for mothers and were able to use the simplified materials to share information about basic mental health concepts Limited time was the biggest challenge CHWs would benefit from additional training and women would likely benefit from additional sessions This research may be useful to

39977859,Leveraging Large Language Models for Infectious Disease SurveillanceUsing a Web Service for Monitoring COVID19 Patterns From SelfReporting Tweets Content Analysis,The emergence of new SARSCoV2 variants the resulting reinfections and postCOVID19 condition continue to impact many peoples lives Tracking websites like the one at Johns Hopkins University no longer report the daily confirmed cases posing challenges to accurately determine the true extent of infections Many COVID19 cases with mild symptoms are selfassessed at home and reported on social media which provides an opportunity to monitor and understand the progression and evolving trends of the disease We aim to build a publicly available database of COVID19related tweets and extracted information about symptoms and recovery cycles from selfreported tweets We have presented the results of our analysis of infection reinfection recovery and longterm effects of COVID19 on a visualization website that refreshes data on a weekly basis We used Twitter subsequently rebranded as X to collect COVID19related data from which 9 native Englishspeaking annotators annotated a training dataset of COVID19positive selfreporters We then used large language models to identify positive selfreporters from other unannotated tweets We used the Hibert transform to calculate the lead of the prediction curve ahead of the reported curve Finally we presented our findings on symptoms recovery reinfections and longterm effects of COVID19 on the Covlab website We collected 73 million tweets related to COVID19 between January 1 2020 and April 1 2024 including 262278 selfreported cases The predicted number of infection cases by our model is 763 days ahead of the official report In addition to common symptoms we identified some symptoms that were not included in the list from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention such as lethargy and hallucinations Repeat infections were commonly occurring with rates of second and third infections at 749 19644262278 and 137 3593262278 respectively whereas 045 1180262278 also reported that they had been infected 5 times We identified 723 individuals who shared detailed recovery experiences through tweets indicating a substantially reduction in recovery time over the years Specifically the average recovery period decreased from around 30 days in 2020 to approximately 12 days in 2023 In addition geographic information collected from confirmed individuals indicates that the temporal patterns of confirmed cases in states such as California and Texas
