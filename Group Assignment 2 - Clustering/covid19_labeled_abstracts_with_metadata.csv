40472281,Investigating Symptom Duration Using Current Status Data A Case Study of Postacute COVID19 Syndrome,For infectious diseases characterizing symptom duration is of clinical and public health importance Symptom duration may be assessed by surveying infected individuals and querying symptom status at the time of survey response For example in a severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 testing program at the University of Washington participants were surveyed at least 28 days after testing positive and asked to report current symptom status This study design yielded current status data outcome measurements for each respondent consisted only of the time of survey response and a binary indicator of whether symptoms had resolved by that time Such study design benefits from limited risk of recall bias but analyzing the resulting data necessitates tailored statistical tools We review methods for current status data and describe a novel application of modern nonparametric techniques to this setting The proposed approach is valid under weaker assumptions compared with existing methods allows the use of flexible machine learning tools and handles potential survey nonresponse Our method relies on the assumption that the survey response time is conditionally independent of symptom resolution time within strata of measured covariates and we propose an approach to assess the sensitivity of results to deviations from conditional independence From the university study we estimate that 19 of participants experienced ongoing symptoms 30 days after testing positive decreasing to 7 at 90 days We found the estimates to be more sensitive to violations of the conditional independence assumption at 30 days compared with 90 days Female sex fatigue during acute infection and higher viral load were associated with slower symptom resolution The proposed method and accompanying sensitivity analysis procedure provide tools for investigators faced with current status data,"Epidemiology (Cambridge, Mass.)",2025,"Wolock CJ, Jacob S, Bennett JC",10.1097/EDE.0000000000001882,B

40516538,Effects of city design on transport mode choice and exposure to health risks during and after a crisis a retrospective observational analysis,Rapid declines in city mobility during the early stages of the COVID19 pandemic in 2020 resulted in reductions in citizens exposure to transportrelated air pollution and associated health risks as many cities introduced nonpharmaceutical interventions designed to curb the spread of COVID19 However these benefits soon reversed during the pandemics recovery phase ie from September 2020 onwards especially in cities with designs that afforded mode shifts away from public and active transport in favour of private motor vehicles The aim of this study was to understand the association between global city designs transport mode choices and populationlevel risk exposure during 2020 In this retrospective observational analysis we assembled and analysed spatial datasets including historical and predicted pollution levels mobility indicators and measures of individual disease transmission and clustered 507 global cities using a graph neural network approach based on measures of the structural dimensions of each individual citys design and network structures of urban transportation systems We compared city types on the basis of transportation mode shifts air pollution levels and associated health outcomes ie cardiovascular disease ischaemic heart disease respiratory disease asthma and reported COVID19 cases throughout 2020 We estimated risk reductions for these health outcomes across four phases of the pandemic which we defined as the prepandemic entry midcrisis and recovery phases We also identified city designs showing sustained reductions at the end of 2020 in transportrelated air pollution fine particulate matter PM25 and nitrogen dioxide NO2 associated with reduced estimated risk of acute and chronic disease outcomes ie allcause mortality ischaemic heart disease mortality cardiovascular disease respiratory disease and asthma The mean estimated reduction of global NO2 concentrations across the observed cities from the beginning of the entry phase until the midcrisis phase was 376 parts per billion ppb calculated as the difference between observed 2020 mean levels of 1263 ppb and predicted mean levels if the pandemic and mobility restrictions had not occurred of 1639 ppb The mean estimated reduction of global PM25 concentrations across the observed cities was 976 gm3 the difference between observed 2020 mean levels 2903 gm3 and predicted mean levels 3879 gm3 If maintained over the long term the estimated NO2 reduction could have a substantial effect on reducing health risks for both acute and chronic disease equating to an estimated overall reduction in allcause mortality risk of 15 95 CI 2230 a reduction in cardiovascular mortality risk of 41 2660 and a reduction in respiratory disease mortality risk of 19 0830 If the reduction in PM25 concentration estimated in this period was maintained over the long term allcause mortality risk reductions of 189 95 CI 132250 asthma risk reductions of 468 187655 and ischaemic heart disease morbidity risk reductions of 025 0203 could be achieved In the later stages of 2020 city designs primarily in the Americas and Oceania that afforded a mode shift away from public transit to private motor vehicles during the pandemics recovery phase tended to show the poorest outcomes across all air pollution and health measures even increasing risk levels above prepandemic baselines in some cases By contrast cities located in Japan and South Korea showed little change in precrisis and postcrisis transport mode choice maintaining comparatively low levels of air pollution and associated disease risk and reduced rates of infectious disease transmission throughout the 2020 observation period Contrasting experiences of road injury in the postpandemic phase ie post 2020 were also observed between these locations Our results highlight the transient environmental and health benefits observed during the early stages of the COVID19 pandemic driven by substantial reductions in transportrelated air pollution and associated health risks due to imposed nonpharmaceutical public health interventions City design appears to have played a crucial role in observed pollution and health risk differences between cities with those that afforded a shift away from public and active transport towards private vehicles witnessing a rapid erosion of pollutionrelated health benefits gained in the entry to
