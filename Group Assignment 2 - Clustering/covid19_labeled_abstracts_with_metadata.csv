40472281,Investigating Symptom Duration Using Current Status Data A Case Study of Postacute COVID19 Syndrome,For infectious diseases characterizing symptom duration is of clinical and public health importance Symptom duration may be assessed by surveying infected individuals and querying symptom status at the time of survey response For example in a severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 testing program at the University of Washington participants were surveyed at least 28 days after testing positive and asked to report current symptom status This study design yielded current status data outcome measurements for each respondent consisted only of the time of survey response and a binary indicator of whether symptoms had resolved by that time Such study design benefits from limited risk of recall bias but analyzing the resulting data necessitates tailored statistical tools We review methods for current status data and describe a novel application of modern nonparametric techniques to this setting The proposed approach is valid under weaker assumptions compared with existing methods allows the use of flexible machine learning tools and handles potential survey nonresponse Our method relies on the assumption that the survey response time is conditionally independent of symptom resolution time within strata of measured covariates and we propose an approach to assess the sensitivity of results to deviations from conditional independence From the university study we estimate that 19 of participants experienced ongoing symptoms 30 days after testing positive decreasing to 7 at 90 days We found the estimates to be more sensitive to violations of the conditional independence assumption at 30 days compared with 90 days Female sex fatigue during acute infection and higher viral load were associated with slower symptom resolution The proposed method and accompanying sensitivity analysis procedure provide tools for investigators faced with current status data,"Epidemiology (Cambridge, Mass.)",2025,"Wolock CJ, Jacob S, Bennett JC",10.1097/EDE.0000000000001882,B

39085807,Longterm surveillance of SARSCoV2 in the school community from Campo Grande Brazil,The COVID19 pandemic has significantly impacted education systems worldwide with Brazil being one of the countries with the longest school closures Over a million children and teenagers have been affected leading to increased hunger and nutritional deficiencies This study aimed to implement longterm surveillance of SARSCoV2 infections in public and private schools in Campo Grande Brazil after returning to inperson classes The study involved testing and genomic surveillance at 23 public and private schools in Campo Grande Mato Grosso do Sul Brazil from October 18 2021 to November 21 2022 The participants eligible for enrollment were students aged 617 years and staff members from school institutions At the time of collection participants were asked if they had symptoms in the last two weeks Wholegenome sequencing of SARSCoV2 was conducted to identify circulating variants and to compare them with those detected in the municipality The demographic data and clinical history of the participants were described and a logistic regression model was used to understand how the RTqPCR results could be related to different characteristics The study included 999 participants most of whom were women A total of 85 tests were positive with an overall positivity rate of 32 The dynamics of case frequency were consistent with those observed in the municipality during the study period The most common symptoms reported were cough rhinorrhea headache and sore throat Symptoms were significantly associated with SARSCoV2 infection Eleven lineages were identified in school community samples with a frequency of occurrence per period similar to that found in the sequences available for the municipality The most prevalent lineages within the sampling period were BA2 593 and BA5 296 Our findings demonstrate that schools can play a crucial role in epidemiological surveillance helping trigger rapid responses to pathogens such as SARSCoV2 Longterm surveillance can be used to track outbreaks and assess the role of children and adults in transmission It can also contribute to pandemic preparedness enabling a rapid response to emergencies such as COVID19,BMC public health,2024,"Alcantara DMC, Dos Santos CM, Torres JM",10.1186/s12889-024-19555-x,E
