40266230,Robust COVID19 Vaccine Responses Despite Filarial CoInfection Insights from a Lymphatic Filariasis Cohort in Ghana,Although the COVID19 pandemic has largely concluded the varied trajectories it has followed in different regions of the world remain incompletely understood Intensive research is needed to fully grasp its course and the implications for future global health challenges Notably the milder trajectory of the COVID19 pandemic in SubSaharan Africa has defied initial predictions An emerging body of evidence suggests that in addition to the continents younger average age and the lower prevalence of relevant comorbidities coinfections with helminths may have also impressively shaped the pandemics milder trajectory in the region Indeed helminths are renowned for their ability to modulate human immune responses which while potentially beneficial in limiting excessive inflammation could also diminish vaccine efficacy and impede viral clearance This study investigated different aspects of the intricate interactions between COVID19 and Lymphatic Filariasis LF a helminth infection caused by parasitic worms such as Wuchereria bancrofti Brugia malayi and Brugia timori and endemic to various regions in SubSaharan Africa and the tropics For this purpose samples of a larger and ongoing clinical trial ethical approval codes CHRPEAP52517 and 32521 trial registration

their Lymphoedema LE stages as well as COVID19 vaccinated n  81 and nonvaccinated individuals n  141 All vaccinated participants received the COVID19 vaccine ChAdOx1S also known as Vaxzevria developed by the University of Oxford and AstraZenca The expressions of SARSCoV2 and filarialspecific antibodies IgG IgA were accessed using ELISA while Luminexbased immunoassays were employed to measure the expression of SARSCoV2 variantspecific neutralizing antibodies The interplay between vaccine responses and demographic factors was analyzed using group comparisons with the KruskalWallis or MannWhitney U tests The results indicate that a remarkable portion of unvaccinated individuals 56 IgA seropositive 39 IgG seropositive developed antibodies against SARSCoV2 despite no confirmed infection Notably the study identified a robust antibody response to COVID19 vaccination which was independent of the degree of LF pathology or parasitic status An important observation was the reduced SARSCoV2 antibody response in individuals seropositive for Ascaris lumbricoides p  00264 highlighting an interaction between roundworm infection and COVID19 The study concludes that the ChAdOx1S COVID19 vaccine AstraZeneca triggers a strong immune response in LF patients however filarial andor soiltransmitted helminth seropositivity might influence the COVID19 infectioninduced

40013770,Recombinant infectious bronchitis virus containing mutations in nonstructural proteins 10 14 15 and 16 and within the macrodomain provides complete protection against homologous challenge,Infectious bronchitis virus IBV is the etiological agent of infectious bronchitis an acute highly contagious economically important disease of chickens Vaccination uses live attenuated vaccines LAVs that are generated via serial passage of a virulent field isolate through embryonated hens eggs typically 80100 times The molecular basis of attenuation is unknown and varies with each attenuation procedure To investigate specifically targeted attenuation we utilized reverse genetics to target the macrodomain 1 Mac1 domain within nonstructural protein 3 of the virulent M41 strain Macrodomains are found in a variety of viruses including coronaviruses and have been associated with the modulation of the hosts innate response Two recombinant IBVs rIBVs were generated with specific single point mutations either Asn42Ala N42A or Gly49Ser G49S within the Mac1 domain generating rIBVs M41KN42A and M41KG49S respectively Replication in vitro was unaffected and the mutations were stably maintained during passaging in vitro and in ovo While M41KN42A exhibited an attenuated phenotype in vivo M41KG49S was only partially attenuated The attenuated in vivo phenotypes observed do not appear to be linked to a reduction in viral replication and additionally M41KN42A highlighted the N42A mutation as a method of rational attenuation Vaccination of chickens with either rIBV M41KN42A or a rIBV containing the Mac1 N42A mutation and our previously identified attenuating Nsp10 and 14 mutations Pro85Leu and Val393Leu respectively offered complete protection from homologous challenge The presence of multiple attenuating mutations did not appear to negatively impact vaccine efficacy Infection of chickens with the Gammacoronavirus infectious bronchitis virus IBV causes an acute respiratory disease resulting in reduced weight gain and reductions in egg laying making it a global concern for poultry industries and food security Vaccination against IBV uses live attenuated viruses LAVs generated by multiple passages of a virulent virus through embryonated hens eggs The molecular basis of attenuation is unknown and unpredictable requiring a fine balance between loss of virulence and vaccine efficacy In this study we targeted the macrodomain of IBV for rational attenuation demonstrating a single point mutation can result in loss of pathogenicity An IBV vaccine candidate was subsequently generated containing three specific attenuating mutations to reduce the risk of reversion which completely protected chickens The targets in this study are conserved among

40340717,Reproducibility of genetic risk factors identified for long COVID using combinatorial analysis across US and UK patient cohorts with diverse ancestries,Long COVID is a major public health burden causing a diverse array of debilitating symptoms in tens of millions of patients globally In spite of this overwhelming disease prevalence staggering cost severe impact on patients lives and intense global research efforts study of the disease has proved challenging due to its complexity Genomewide association studies GWAS have identified only four loci potentially associated with the disease although these results did not statistically replicate between studies A previous combinatorial analysis study identified a total of 73 genes that were highly associated with two long COVID cohorts in the predominantly  91 white European ancestry Sano GOLD population and we sought to reproduce these findings in the independent and ancestrally more diverse All of Us AoU population We assessed the reproducibility of the 5343 long COVID disease signatures from the original study in the AoU population Because the very small population sizes provide very limited power to replicate findings we initially tested whether we observed a statistically significant enrichment of the Sano GOLD disease signatures that are also positively correlated with long COVID in the AoU cohort after controlling for population substructure For the Sano GOLD disease signatures that have a case frequency greater than 5 in AoU we consistently observed a significant enrichment 7783 p  001 of signatures that are also positively associated with long COVID in the AoU cohort These encompassed 92 of the genes identified in the original study At least five of the disease signatures found in Sano GOLD were also shown to be individually significantly associated with increased long COVID prevalence in the AoU population Rates of signature reproducibility are strongest among selfidentified white patients but we also observe significant enrichment of reproducing disease associations in selfidentified blackAfricanAmerican and HispanicLatino cohorts Signatures associated with 11 out of the 13 drug repurposing candidates identified in the original Sano GOLD study were reproduced in this study These results demonstrate the reproducibility of long COVID disease signal found by combinatorial analysis broadly validating the results of the original analysis They provide compelling evidence for a much broader array of genetic associations with long COVID than previously identified through traditional GWAS studies This strongly supports the hypothesis that genetic factors play a critical role in determining an individuals susceptibility to long COVID following recovery from acute SARSCoV2 infection It also lends weight to the drug repurposing candidates identified in the original analysis Together these results may help to stimulate much needed new precision medicine approaches to more effectively diagnose and treat the disease This is also the first reproduction of long COVID genetic associations across multiple populations with substantially different ancestry distributions Given the high reproducibility rate across diverse populations these findings may have broader clinical application and promote better health equity We hope that this will provide confidence to explore some of these mechanisms and drug targets and help advance research into novel ways to diagnose the disease and accelerate the discovery and selection of better

40459919,A Comprehensive DriftAdaptive Framework for Sustaining Model Performance in COVID19 Detection From Dynamic Cough Audio Data Model Development and Validation,The COVID19 pandemic has highlighted the need for robust and adaptable diagnostic tools capable of detecting the disease from diverse and continuously evolving data sources Machine learning models particularly convolutional neural networks are promising in this regard However the dynamic nature of realworld data can lead to model drift where the models performance degrades over time as the underlying data distribution changes due to evolving disease characteristics demographic shifts and variations in recording conditions Addressing this challenge is crucial to maintaining the accuracy and reliability of these models in ongoing diagnostic applications This study aims to develop a comprehensive framework that not only monitors model drift over time but also uses adaptation mechanisms to mitigate performance fluctuations in COVID19 detection models trained on dynamic cough audio data Two crowdsourced COVID19 audio datasets namely COVID19 Sounds and Coswara were used for development and evaluation purposes Each dataset was divided into 2 distinct periods namely the development period and postdevelopment period A baseline convolutional neural network model was initially trained and evaluated using data ie coughs from COVID19 Sounds and shallow coughs from Coswara dataset from the development period To detect changes in data distributions and the models performance between these periods the maximum mean discrepancy distance was used Upon detecting significant drift a retraining procedure was triggered to update the baseline model The study explored 2 model adaptation approaches unsupervised domain adaptation and active learning both of which were comparatively assessed The baseline model achieved an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 6913 and a balanced accuracy of 6338 on the development test set of the COVID19 Sounds dataset while for the Coswara dataset the corresponding values were 668 and 6164 A decline in performance was observed when the model was evaluated on data from the postdevelopment period indicating the presence of model drift The application of the unsupervised domain adaptation approach led to performance improvement in terms of balanced accuracy by up to 22 and 24 for the COVID19 Sounds and Coswara datasets respectively The active learning approach yielded even greater improvement corresponding to a balanced accuracy increase of up to 30 and 60 for the 2 datasets respectively The proposed framework successfully addresses the challenge of model drift in COVID19 detection by enabling continuous adaptation to evolving data distributions This approach ensures sustained model performance over time contributing to the development of robust and adaptable diagnostic tools for COVID19 and potentially other

40397945,Identifying Disinformation on the Extended Impacts of COVID19 Methodological Investigation Using a Fuzzy Ranking Ensemble of Natural Language Processing Models,During the COVID19 pandemic the continuous spread of misinformation on the internet posed an ongoing threat to public trust and understanding of epidemic prevention policies Although the pandemic is now under control information regarding the risks of longterm COVID19 effects and reinfection still needs to be integrated into COVID19 policies This study aims to develop a robust and generalizable deep learning framework for detecting misinformation related to the prolonged impacts of COVID19 by integrating pretrained language models PLMs with an innovative fuzzy rankbased ensemble approach A comprehensive dataset comprising 566 genuine and 2361 fake samples was curated from reliable open sources and processed using advanced techniques The dataset was randomly split using the scikitlearn package to facilitate both training and evaluation Deep learning models were trained for 20 epochs on a Tesla T4 for hierarchical attention networks HANs and an RTX A5000 for the other models To enhance performance we implemented an ensemble learning strategy that incorporated a reparameterized Gompertz function which assigned fuzzy ranks based on each models prediction confidence for each test case This method

40146993,An ensemble approach improves the prediction of the COVID19 pandemic in South Korea,Modelling can contribute to disease prevention and control strategies Accurate predictions of future cases and mortality rates were essential for establishing appropriate policies during the COVID19 pandemic However no single model yielded definite conclusions with each having specific strengths and weaknesses Here we propose an ensemble learning approach which can offset the limitations of each model and improve prediction performances We generated predictions for the transmission and impact of COVID19 in South Korea using seven individual models including mathematical statistical and machine learning approaches We integrated these predictions using three ensemble methods stacking average

performance using five error measures r2 weighted mean absolute percentage error WMAPE autoregressive integrated moving average ARIMA mean squared error MSE root mean squared error RMSE and mean absolute percentage error MAPE and selected the optimal covariate combination accordingly To validate the generalisability of our approach we applied the same modelling framework to USA data Booster

the human population Serial passaging in vitro offers a complementary controlled environment to investigate the emergence and persistence of genetic variants that may confer selective advantage In this study nine virus lineages including four variants of concern and three former variants under investigation were sampled over 33 serial passages range 33100 in Vero E6 cells WGS was used to examine virus evolutionary dynamics and identify key mutations with implications for fitness andor transmissibility Viruses accumulated mutations regularly during serial passaging Many lowfrequency variants were lost but others became fixed suggesting either in vitro benefits or at least a lack of deleterious effect Mutations arose convergently both across passage lines and when compared with contemporaneous SARSCoV2 clinical sequences These mutations included some that are hypothesized to drive lineage success through host immune evasion eg SA67V SH655Y The appearance of these mutations

40488473,The effect of early COVID19 treatment with convalescent plasma on antibody responses to SARSCoV2,At the COVID19 pandemic onset convalescent plasma collected from patients recovered from severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 SARSCoV2 infection emerged as a potential treatment option but the effect on the patient immune response was unclear To determine treatment effect on the infection antibody response plasma samples were collected through 90 days from 104 SARSCoV2infected participants after receiving CCP or control plasma as part of a multicenter doubleblind randomized controlled early treatment trial Enzyme immunoassay EIA was used to quantify binding IgG IgA and IgM to nucleocapsid N protein and IgG to the USAWA12020 spike S protein Avidity assessed antibody maturation CCP transfusion boosted posttransfusion plasma levels of Nspecific IgG but not IgA or IgM and had a lesser effect on Sspecific IgG Over the first 2 weeks both trial arm groups generated IgM IgA and IgG to N and IgG to S with comparable levels at 1490 days after transfusion Levels of IgM and IgA subsequently declined while IgG was maintained through day 90 for both interventions Avidity of Nspecific IgG increased steadily over the 3month followup in both groups but Sspecific IgG avidity improved only for those in the CCP group Improved antibody titer correlated with improved avidity over time in both groups Antibody levels and avidity between early ves late transfusion from symptom onset by trial arm intervention were also similar In summary CCP administration had no negative effects on the humoral response to SARSCoV2 infection and was associated with qualitatively improved antibodies with higher avidityIMPORTANCEMonoclonal antibody infusion prevented COVID19 hospitalizations However the massive monoclonal antibody dose near 7 of total circulating antibodies has been shown to decrease patient generation of SARSCoV2 specific IgM and lower responses to vaccination possibly by decreasing generation of high avidity neutralization epitopes near the monoclonal binding epitope We characterized diverse antibody population quality and quantity among intervention groups in the polyclonal COVID19 convalescent plasma CCP randomized control trial effective in reducing hospitalizations by more than 50 in all participants and 80 in those

40481413,Anthropogenic influences on Rhodnius ecuadoriensis populations and nesting behaviors in sylvatic areas of southern ecuador,Chagas disease caused by the parasite Trypanosoma cruzi remains a major public health concern While Rhodnius ecuadoriensis a key vector is traditionally sylvatic environmental disturbances have driven its adaptation to humaninfluenced habitats This study explores a novel factor how anthropogenic waste affects vector ecology by altering nest compositions Unlike prior research this study examines whether humanderived materials in nests influence triatomine colonization Given rising pollution particularly postCOVID19 understanding its role in disease transmission is essential for developing innovative vector control strategies Nest records were collected and analyzed in 2018 2022 and 2023 across eight communities in Loja province Ecuador Nests were categorized as peridomestic if found 30 m away The number of insects found in these nests was quantified using entomological indices Pearson correlation analysis was applied to assess relationships between nest location and the presence of anthropogenic materials A total of 389 nests were examined yielding 1089 individuals of Rhodnius ecuadoriensis including both nymphs and adults The infestation index in peridomestic areas dramatically decreased from 333 in 2018 to 0 in 2022 highlighting an intriguing temporal shift that warrants further investigation In contrast sylvatic areas showed fluctuating infestation rates 275 in 2018 165 in 2022 and 222 in 2023 The study uniquely identified a significant association between triatomine infestation and mammal nests with 501 of infested nests located within mammal habitats Notably 352 of these nests contained anthropogenic materials particularly near humanaltered landscapes such as roads and paths The weak to moderate negative correlation between the presence of anthropogenic materials and proximity to roads or rivers r  0361 p  0039 highlights an innovative exploration of the influence of human environmental changes on vector ecology This study offers a novel perspective on the dual impact of increasing pollution levels on wildlife It highlights how anthropogenic waste not only reduces vector populations but also increases mortality rates through entanglement in waste materials These findings underscore the urgent need

40474068,Sociodemographic determinants of COVID19 vaccination status among people living with HIV a crosssectional study in selected regions in Tanzania,Public Health and Social Measures PHSM are among the commonly used methods to prevent the spread of Corona Virus Disease of 2029 COVID19 Vaccination has also been an integral component of infectious disease prevention and control and it has been used widely to protect humans against some of the very serious diseases such as COVID19 People living with HIV PLHIV are known to be more vulnerable to the severest form of COVID19 than the general population Other groups of people likely to get the severe form of COVID19 include the elderly and those with comorbidities such as cancers cardiovascular diseases diabetes etc OBJECTIVES The main objective of the study was to establish sociodemographic factors that could determine COVID19 vaccination status among PLHIV in selected regions in mainland Tanzania and to provide insight into ways to increase COVID19 vaccine coverage in Tanzania A facilitybased crosssectional study was conducted between March and April 2022 among PLHIV in four conveniently sampled regions of Tanzania namely Kagera Tabora Geita and Dar es Salaam A total of 25 Care and Treatment Centres CTCs were randomly selected with a probability proportion by size in each region In each CTC 11 PLHIV eligible for vaccination were systematically selected to participate in the study Facetoface interviews were conducted using a structured questionnaire and Open Data Kit ODK software was used to record and transfer data to a designated server Data cleaning and analysis were done using Stata version 140 A chisquare test was used to assess the association between sociodemographic characteristics and COVID19 vaccination status A generalized linear mixedeffects model was fitted to determine factors associated with COVID19 vaccination status Out of 1100 PLHIV interviewed 696 633 were found to be vaccinated against COVID19 Level of education age occupation employment status location and level of health facilities were found to be significantly associated with of COVID19 vaccination status among PLHIV in the study areas PLHIV who had college and university education elderly farmers and those employed and living in a rural setting were found to be more likely to be vaccinated than other comparison groups in the categories analyzed This facilitybased crosssectional study showed a higher COVID19 vaccination rate 633 among PLHIV compared to the general population This could be explained by efforts by both public and private sectors to promote COVID19 vaccination among PLHIV have had a positive impact on vaccination uptake However to meet the World Health Organization WHO target of 60 vaccination coverage additional tailored interventions are required These should include specific strategies that could be effective in urban areas expanding vaccination access by increasing the number of vaccinations centers supporting those who face barriers to vaccination and actively engaging not only elderly individuals but also middleaged and younger members of the community and PLHIV networks Moreover greater involvement from higher levels of health service provision such as health centers and hospitals will be likely increase vaccination coverage and address the unmet needs of

39557769,Identification of Novel Genomic Variants in COVID19 Patients Using WholeExome Sequencing Exploring the Plausible Targets of Functional Genomics,Covid19 caused by SARSCoV2 virus has emerged as an immense burden and an unparalleled global health challenge in recorded human history The clinical characteristics and risk factors of COVID19 exhibit considerable variability leading to a spectrum of clinical severity Moreover the likelihood of exposure to the virus may differ based on comorbidity status as comorbid illnesses have mechanisms that can considerably increase mortality by reducing the bodys ability to withstand injury The mammalian target of rapamycin mTOR pathway is essential for orchestrating innate immune cell defense including cytokine production and is dysregulated in severe Coronavirus Disease 2019 COVID19 individuals Through genomewide association studies numerous genetic variants in the human host have been identified that have a significant impact on the immune response to SARSCoV2 To identify potentially significant genetic variants in Covid19 patients that could affect the risk severity and clinical outcome of the infection this study has used wholeexome sequencing WES on the 16 COVID19 patients with varying comorbidities and severity of the disease including fatal outcomes Among them 8 patients made a full recovery and were discharged while 8 patients unfortunately did not survive due to the severity of the illness and majority of them were males The study identified 10204 variants in the patients From 1120 variants which were chosen for novel variant analysis using mutation function prediction tools to identify deleterious variants that could affect normal gene function 116 variants of 57 genes were found to be deleterious These variants were further classified as likely pathogenic and variants of uncertain significance The data showed that among the likely pathogenic variants five genes were identified in connection to immune response whereas two were related to respiratory system The common variants associated with the covid19 phenotype showed the top 10 significant genes identified in this study such as ERCC2

39494864,Deciphering Bordetella pertussis epidemiology through cultureindependent multiplex amplicon and metagenomic sequencing,Whooping cough pertussis has reemerged despite high vaccine coverage in Australia and many other countries worldwide partly attributable to genetic adaptation of the causative organism Bordetella pertussis to vaccines Therefore genomic surveillance has become essential to monitor circulating strains for these genetic changes However increasing uptake of PCR for the diagnosis of pertussis has affected the availability of cultured isolates for typing In this study we evaluated the use of targeted multiplex PCR mPCR amplicon sequencing and shotgun metagenomic sequencing for cultureindependent typing of B pertussis directly from respiratory swabs We developed a ninetarget mPCR amplicon assay that could accurately type major lineages ptxP3nonptxpP3 fim3AB fhaB3nonfhaB3 and epidemic lineages ELs 15 circulating in Australia Validation using DNA from isolates

Shotgun metagenomic sequencing was successful in genotyping B pertussis in 84 of clinical specimens with PCR Ct Bordetella holmesii This study provides valuable insight into the circulating lineages in Australia prior to the COVID19 pandemic during which border closure and other interventions reduced pertussis cases to an alltime low and paves the way for the genomic surveillance of B pertussis in the era of cultureindependent PCRbased diagnosis In this paper we evaluated the use of targeted multiplex PCR mPCR amplicon sequencing and shotgun metagenomic sequencing for cultureindependent typing of Bordetella pertussis directly in respiratory swabs We first developed a novel targeted mPCR amplicon sequencing assay that can type major circulating lineages and validated its accuracy and sensitivity on 178 DNA extracts from clinical swabs We also demonstrate the feasibility of using deep metagenomic sequencing for determining strain lineage and markers of virulence vaccine adaptation macrolide resistance and coinfections Our cultureindependent typing methods applied to clinical specimens revealed the expansion of a major global epidemic lineage in Australia termed EL4 just prior to the COVID19 pandemic It also detected cases of previously hidden coinfections from another Bordetella species called Bordetella holmesii These findings offer valuable insight into the circulating pertussis lineages in Australia prior to the COVID19 pandemic during which border closure and other interventions reduced pertussis cases to an alltime low It also provides comparative data for future surveillance as pertussis resurgence after the COVID19 pandemic has been reported this year in Australia and many other countries Overall our paper demonstrates the utility sensitivity and specificity
