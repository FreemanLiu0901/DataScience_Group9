40397945,Identifying Disinformation on the Extended Impacts of COVID19 Methodological Investigation Using a Fuzzy Ranking Ensemble of Natural Language Processing Models,During the COVID19 pandemic the continuous spread of misinformation on the internet posed an ongoing threat to public trust and understanding of epidemic prevention policies Although the pandemic is now under control information regarding the risks of longterm COVID19 effects and reinfection still needs to be integrated into COVID19 policies This study aims to develop a robust and generalizable deep learning framework for detecting misinformation related to the prolonged impacts of COVID19 by integrating pretrained language models PLMs with an innovative fuzzy rankbased ensemble approach A comprehensive dataset comprising 566 genuine and 2361 fake samples was curated from reliable open sources and processed using advanced techniques The dataset was randomly split using the scikitlearn package to facilitate both training and evaluation Deep learning models were trained for 20 epochs on a Tesla T4 for hierarchical attention networks HANs and an RTX A5000 for the other models To enhance performance we implemented an ensemble learning strategy that incorporated a reparameterized Gompertz function which assigned fuzzy ranks based on each models prediction confidence for each test case This method effectively fused outputs from stateoftheart PLMs such as robustly optimized bidirectional encoder representations from transformers pretraining approach RoBERTa decodingenhanced bidirectional encoder representations from transformers with disentangled attention DeBERTa and XLNet After training on the dataset various classification methods were evaluated on the test set including the fuzzy rankbased method and stateoftheart large language models Experimental results reveal that language models particularly XLNet outperform traditional approaches that combine term frequencyinverse document frequency features with support vector machine or utilize deep models like HAN The evaluation metricsincluding accuracy precision recall F1score and area under the curve AUCindicated a clear performance advantage for models that had a larger number of parameters However this study also highlights that model architecture training procedures and optimization techniques are critical determinants of classification effectiveness XLNets permutation language modeling approach enhances bidirectional context understanding allowing it to surpass even larger models in the bidirectional encoder representations from transformers BERT series despite having relatively fewer parameters Notably the fuzzy rankbased ensemble method which combines multiple language models achieved impressive results on the test set with an accuracy of 9352 a precision of 9465 an F1score of 9603 and an AUC of 9715 The fusion of ensemble learning with PLMs and the Gompertz function employing fuzzy rankbased methodology introduces a novel prediction approach with prospects for enhancing accuracy and reliability Additionally the experimental results imply that training solely on textual content can yield high prediction accuracy thereby providing valuable insights into the optimization of fake news detection systems These findings not only aid in detecting misinformation but also have broader

40340717,Reproducibility of genetic risk factors identified for long COVID using combinatorial analysis across US and UK patient cohorts with diverse ancestries,Long COVID is a major public health burden causing a diverse array of debilitating symptoms in tens of millions of patients globally In spite of this overwhelming disease prevalence staggering cost severe impact on patients lives and intense global research efforts study of the disease has proved challenging due to its complexity Genomewide association studies GWAS have identified only four loci potentially associated with the disease although these results did not statistically replicate between studies A previous combinatorial analysis study identified a total of 73 genes that were highly associated with two long COVID cohorts in the predominantly  91 white European ancestry Sano GOLD population and we sought to reproduce these findings in the independent and ancestrally more diverse All of Us AoU population We assessed the reproducibility of the 5343 long COVID disease signatures from the original study in the AoU population Because the very small population sizes provide very limited power to replicate findings we initially tested whether we observed a statistically significant enrichment of the Sano GOLD disease signatures that are also positively correlated with long COVID in the AoU cohort after controlling for population substructure For the Sano GOLD disease signatures that have a case frequency greater than 5 in AoU we consistently observed a significant enrichment 7783 p  001 of signatures that are also positively associated with long COVID in the AoU cohort These encompassed 92 of the genes identified in the original study At least five of the disease signatures found in Sano GOLD were also shown to be individually significantly associated with increased long COVID prevalence in the AoU population Rates of signature reproducibility are strongest among selfidentified white patients but we also observe significant enrichment of reproducing disease associations in selfidentified blackAfricanAmerican and HispanicLatino cohorts Signatures associated with 11 out of the 13 drug repurposing candidates identified in the original Sano GOLD study were reproduced in this study These results demonstrate the reproducibility of long COVID disease signal found by combinatorial analysis broadly validating the results of the original analysis They provide compelling evidence for a much broader array of genetic associations with long COVID than previously identified through traditional GWAS studies This strongly supports the hypothesis that genetic factors play a critical role in determining an individuals susceptibility to long COVID following recovery from acute SARSCoV2 infection It also lends weight to the drug repurposing candidates identified in the original analysis Together these results may help to stimulate much needed new precision medicine approaches to more effectively diagnose and treat the disease This is also the first reproduction of long COVID genetic associations across multiple populations with substantially different ancestry distributions Given the high reproducibility rate across diverse populations these findings may have broader clinical application and promote better health equity We hope that this will provide confidence to explore some of these mechanisms and drug targets and help advance research into novel ways to diagnose the disease and accelerate the discovery and selection of better therapeutic options both in the form of newly discovered drugs andor the immediate prioritization of coordinated investigations into the efficacy of repurposed drug candidates,Journal of translational

condition is emerging as a new epidemic characterized by the persistence of COVID19 symptoms beyond 3 months and is anticipated to substantially alter the lives of millions of people globally Patients with severe episodes of COVID19 are significantly more likely to be hospitalized in the following months The pathophysiological mechanisms for delayed complications are still poorly understood with a dissociation seen between ongoing symptoms and objective measures of cardiopulmonary health COVID19 is anticipated to alter the longterm trajectory of many chronic cardiovascular and pulmonary diseases which are common among those at risk of severe disease This study aims to use a single integrated deviceMouthLab which measures 10 vital health parameters in 60 secondsand a cloudbased proprietary analytics engine to develop and validate the Aidar Decompensation Index AIDI to predict decompensation in health among patients who previously had severe COVID19 Overall 200 participants will be enrolled Inclusion criteria are patients in the US Department of Veterans Affairs health care system severe COVID19 infection during the acute phase defined as requiring hospitalization within 36 months before enrollment aged 18 years and having 1 of 6 prespecified chronic conditions All participants will be instructed to use the MouthLab device to capture daily physiological data and complete monthly symptom surveys Structured data collection tables will be developed to extract the clinical characteristics of those who experience decompensation events DEs The performance of the AIDI will depend on the magnitude of difference in physiological signals between those experiencing DEs and those who do not as well as the time until a DE ie the closer to the event the easier the prediction Information about demographics symptoms Medical Research Council Dyspnea Scale and PostCOVID19 Functional Status Scale comorbidities and other clinical characteristics will be tagged and added to the biomarker data The resultant predicted probability of decompensation will be translated into the AIDI where there will be a linear relationship between the risk score and the AIDI To improve prediction accuracy data may be stratified based on biological sex race ethnicity or underlying clinical characteristics into subgroups to determine if there are differences in performance and detection lead times Using appropriate algorithmic techniques the study expects the model to have a sensitivity of 80 and a positive predicted value of 70 Recruitment began in January 2023 and at the

40397945,Identifying Disinformation on the Extended Impacts of COVID19 Methodological Investigation Using a Fuzzy Ranking Ensemble of Natural Language Processing Models,During the COVID19 pandemic the continuous spread of misinformation on the internet posed an ongoing threat to public trust and understanding of epidemic prevention policies Although the pandemic is now under control information regarding the risks of longterm COVID19 effects and reinfection still needs to be integrated into COVID19 policies This study aims to develop a robust and generalizable deep learning framework for detecting misinformation related to the prolonged impacts of COVID19 by integrating pretrained language models PLMs with an innovative fuzzy rankbased ensemble approach A comprehensive dataset comprising 566 genuine and 2361 fake samples was curated from reliable open sources and processed using advanced techniques The dataset was randomly split using the scikitlearn package to facilitate both training and evaluation Deep learning models were trained for 20 epochs on a Tesla T4 for hierarchical attention networks HANs and an RTX A5000 for the other models To enhance performance we implemented an ensemble learning strategy that incorporated a reparameterized Gompertz function which assigned fuzzy ranks based on each models prediction confidence for each test case This method effectively fused outputs from stateoftheart PLMs such as robustly optimized bidirectional encoder representations from transformers pretraining approach RoBERTa decodingenhanced bidirectional encoder representations from transformers with disentangled attention DeBERTa and XLNet After training on the dataset various classification methods were evaluated on the test set including the fuzzy rankbased method and stateoftheart large language models Experimental results reveal that language models particularly XLNet outperform traditional approaches that combine term frequencyinverse document frequency features with support vector machine or utilize deep models like HAN The evaluation metricsincluding accuracy precision recall F1score and area under the curve AUCindicated a clear performance advantage for models that had a larger number of parameters However this study also highlights that model architecture training procedures and optimization techniques are critical determinants of classification effectiveness XLNets permutation language modeling approach enhances bidirectional context understanding allowing it to surpass even larger models in the bidirectional encoder representations from transformers BERT series despite having relatively fewer parameters Notably the fuzzy rankbased ensemble method which combines multiple language models achieved impressive results on the test set with an accuracy of 9352 a precision of 9465 an F1score of 9603 and an AUC of 9715 The fusion of ensemble learning with PLMs and the Gompertz function employing fuzzy rankbased methodology introduces a novel prediction approach with prospects for enhancing accuracy and reliability Additionally the experimental results imply that training solely on textual content can yield high prediction accuracy thereby providing valuable insights into the optimization of fake news detection systems These findings not only aid in detecting misinformation but also have broader implications for the application of advanced deep learning techniques in public health policy and communication,Journal of medical Internet research,2025,"Chen JA, Chung WC, Hung

need to seek out good physicians who viewed MECFS as a physical disorder Tweets on research typically praised studies of biomarkers and biomedical therapies called for greater investment in biomedical research and expressed frustration with studies suggesting a biopsychosocial etiology for MECFS or supporting management with psychotherapy or graduated activity Tweets about the UK NICE guidelines expressed frustration with the 2007 version that recommended cognitive behavioral therapy and graded exercise therapy and a prolonged campaign by advocacy organizations to influence subsequent versions Tweets showed high acceptance of the 2021 UK NICE guidelines which were seen to validate MECFS as a biomedical disease and recommended against graded exercise therapy Tweets about COVID19 often noted overlaps between postCOVID19 condition and MECFS including claims of a common biological pathway and advised there was no cure for either condition Our findings suggest research is needed

disease that affects people globally Beyond affecting the respiratory system COVID19 patients are at an elevated risk for both venous and arterial thrombosis This heightened risk contributes to an increased probability of acute complications including acute myocardial infarction AMI and acute ischemic stroke AIS Given the unclear relationship between COVID19 AMI and AIS it is crucial to gain a deeper understanding of their associations and potential molecular mechanisms This study aims to utilize bioinformatics to analyze gene expression data identify potential therapeutic targets and biomarkers and explore the role of immune cells in the disease This study employed three Gene Expression Omnibus GEO datasets for analysis which included data on COVID19 AMI and AIS We performed enrichment analysis on the coDEGs for these three diseases to clarify gene pathways and functions and also examined the relationship between coDEGs and immune infiltration Machine learning techniques and proteinprotein interaction networks PPI were used to identify hub genes within the coDEGs Finally we employed a dual validation strategy integrating independent GEO datasets and in vitro experiments with human blood samples to comprehensively assess the reliability of our experimental findings We identified 88 coDEGs associated with COVID19 AMI and AIS Enrichment analysis results indicated that coDEGs were significantly enriched in immune inflammatory responses related to leukocytes and neutrophils Immune infiltration analysis revealed significant differences in immune cell populations between the disease group and the normal group Finally genes selected through machine learning methods included CLEC4E S100A12 and IL1R2 Based on the PPI network the top ten most influential DEGs were identified as MMP9 TLR2 TLR4 ITGAM S100A12 FCGR1A CD163 FCER1G FPR2 and CLEC4D The integration of the proteinprotein interaction PPI network with machine learning techniques

39376591,Genetic diversity and genomic epidemiology of SARSCoV2 during the first 3 years of the pandemic in Morocco comprehensive sequence analysis including the unique lineage B1528 in Morocco,During the 3 years following the emergence of the COVID19 pandemic the African continent like other regions of the world was substantially impacted by COVID19 In Morocco the COVID19 pandemic has been marked by the emergence and spread of several SARSCoV2 variants leading to a substantial increase in the incidence of infections and deaths Nevertheless the comprehensive understanding of the genetic diversity evolution and epidemiology of several viral lineages remained limited in Morocco This study sought to deepen the understanding of the genomic epidemiology of SARSCoV2 through a retrospective analysis The main objective of this study was to analyse the genetic diversity of SARSCoV2 and identify distinct lineages as well as assess their evolution during the pandemic in Morocco using genomic epidemiology approaches Furthermore several key mutations in the functional proteins across different viral lineages were highlighted along with an analysis of the genetic relationships amongst these strains to better understand their evolutionary pathways A total of 2274 genomic sequences of SARSCoV2 isolated in Morocco during the period of 2020 to 2023 were extracted from the GISAID EpiCoV database and subjected to analysis Lineages and clades were classified according to the nomenclature of GISAID Nextstrain and Pangolin The study was conducted and reported in accordance with STROBE Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology guidelines An exhaustive analysis of 2274 genomic sequences led to the identification of 157 PANGO lineages including notable lineages such as B1 B11 B1528 and B1177 as well as variants such as B117 B1621 B1525 B1351 B16171 B16172 and its notable sublineages AY33 AY72 AY112 AY121 that evolved over time before being supplanted by Omicron in December 2021 Among the 2274 sequences analysed Omicron and its subvariants had a prevalence of 595 The most predominant clades were 21K 21L and 22B which are respectively related phylogenetically to BA1 BA2 and BA5 In June 2022 Morocco rapidly observed a recrudescence of cases of infection with the emergence and concurrent coexistence of subvariants from clade 22B such as BA5220 BA5 BA51 BA521 and BF5 supplanting the subvariants BA1 clade display 21K and BA2 clade display 21L which became marginal However XBB clade 22F and its progeny such XBB1523A XBB11623B CH1123C

Feasibility Study,Serious pulmonary pathologies of infectious viral or bacterial origin are accompanied by inflammation and an increase in oxidative stress OS In these situations biological measurements of OS are technically difficult to obtain and their results are difficult to interpret OS assays that do not require complex preanalytical methods as well as machine learning methods for improving interpretation of the results would be very useful tools for medical and care teams We aimed to identify relevant OS biomarkers associated with the severity of hospitalized patients condition and identify possible correlations between OS biomarkers and the clinical status of hospitalized patients with COVID19 and severe lung disease at the time of hospital admission All adult patients hospitalized with COVID19 at the Infirmerie Protestante Lyon France from February 9 2022 to May 18 2022 were included regardless of the care service they used during the respiratory infectious COVID19 epidemic We collected serous biomarkers from the patients zinc Zn copper Cu CuZn ratio selenium uric acid highsensitivity Creactive protein hsCRP oxidized lowdensity lipoprotein glutathione peroxidase glutathione reductase and thiols as well as demographic variables and comorbidities A support vector machine SVM model was used to predict the severity of the patients condition based on the collected data as a training set A total of 28 patients were included 8 were asymptomatic at admission grade 0 14 had mild to moderate symptoms grade 1 and 6 had severe to critical symptoms grade 3 As the first outcome we found that 3 biomarkers of OS were associated with severity Zn CuZn ratio and thiols especially between grades 0 and 1 and between grades 0 and 2 As a second outcome we found that the SVM model could predict the level of severity based on a biological analysis of the level of OS with only 7 misclassification on the training dataset As an illustrative example we simulated 3 different biological profiles named A B and C and submitted them to the SVM model Profile B had significantly high Zn low hsCRP a low CuZn ratio and high thiols corresponding to

betablockers for cardiovascular disease indicate that betablocker use is associated with reduced risk of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbation However at the time this study was initiated there had been no randomised controlled trials confirming or refuting this To determine the clinical and costeffectiveness of adding bisoprolol maximal dose 5 mg once daily to usual chronic obstructive pulmonary disease therapies in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease at high risk of exacerbation A multicentre pragmatic doubleblind randomised placebocontrolled clinical trial Seventysix United Kingdom primary and secondary care sites People aged  40 years with a diagnosis of at least moderately severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease with a history of at least two exacerbations in the previous year Participants were randomised 1  1 to receive either bisoprolol or placebo for 1 year During a 4 to 7week titration period the maximum tolerated dose was established 125 mg 25 mg 375 mg 5 mg once daily A number of participantreported exacerbations during the 1year treatment period In total 519 participants were recruited and randomised Four

participants with serious adverse events was similar between the two groups bisoprolol 37 placebo 36 The total number of adverse reactions was also similar between the two groups As expected bisoprolol was associated with a higher proportion of vascular adverse reactions eg hypotension cold peripheries than placebo but was not associated with an excess of other adverse reactions including those classified as respiratory Adding bisoprolol resulted in a statistically insignificant trend towards higher costs 636 95 confidence interval 118 to 1391 and fewer qualityadjusted lifeyears 0035 95 confidence interval 0059 to 0010 compared to placebo The study findings should be interpreted with caution as the target sample size of 1574 was not achieved because the funder considered the study to be unviable in the COVID19 pandemic clinical research environment Although 28 of participants did not initiate bisoprololplacebo 16 or ceased during the treatment period 262 this is consistent with similar trials in the United Kingdom In this underpowered study the addition of bisoprolol to usual chronic obstructive pulmonary disease treatment did not reduce the likelihood of exacerbations and

40146990,Generative Large Language ModelPowered Conversational AI App for Personalized Risk Assessment Case Study in COVID19,Large language models LLMs have demonstrated powerful capabilities in natural language tasks and are increasingly being integrated into health care for tasks like disease risk assessment Traditional machine learning methods rely on structured data and coding limiting their flexibility in dynamic clinical environments This study presents a novel approach to disease risk assessment using generative LLMs through conversational artificial intelligence AI eliminating the need for programming This study evaluates the use of pretrained generative LLMs including LLaMA27b and FlanT5xl for COVID19 severity prediction with the goal of enabling a realtime nocode risk assessment solution through chatbotbased questionanswering interactions To contextualize their performance we compare LLMs with traditional machine learning classifiers such as logistic regression extreme gradient boosting XGBoost and random forest which rely on tabular data We finetuned LLMs using fewshot natural language examples from a dataset of 393 pediatric patients developing a mobile app that integrates these models to provide realtime nocode COVID19 severity risk assessment through clinicianpatient interaction The LLMs were compared with traditional classifiers across different experimental settings using the area under the curve AUC as the primary evaluation metric Feature importance derived from LLM attention layers was also analyzed to enhance interpretability Generative LLMs demonstrated strong performance in lowdata settings In zeroshot scenarios the T03bT model achieved an AUC of 075 while other LLMs such as T0pp8bitT and FlanT5xlT reached 067 and 069 respectively At 2shot settings logistic regression and random forest achieved an AUC of 057 while FlanT5xlT and T03bT obtained 069 and 065 respectively By 32shot settings FlanT5xlT reached 070 similar to logistic regression 069 and random forest 068 while XGBoost improved to 065 These results illustrate the differences in how generative LLMs and traditional models handle the increasing data availability LLMs perform well in lowdata scenarios whereas traditional models rely more on structured tabular data and labeled training examples Furthermore the mobile app provides realtime COVID19 severity assessments and personalized insights through attentionbased feature importance adding value to the clinical interpretation of the results Generative LLMs provide a robust alternative to traditional classifiers particularly in scenarios with limited labeled data Their ability to handle unstructured inputs and deliver personalized realtime assessments without coding makes them highly adaptable to

40070694,Leveraging nearrealtime patient and population data to incorporate fluctuating risk of severe COVID19 development and prospective validation of a personalised risk prediction tool,Novel strategies that account for populationlevel changes in dominant variants immunity testing practices and changes in individual risk profiles are needed to identify patients who remain at high risk of severe COVID19 The aim of this study was to develop and prospectively validate a tool to predict absolute risk of severe COVID19 incorporating dynamic parameters at the patient and population levels that could be used to inform clinical care A retrospective cohort of vaccinated US Veterans with SARSCoV2 from July 1 2021 through August 25 2023 was created Models were estimated using logisticregressionbased machine learning with backward selection and included a variable with fluctuating absolute risk of severe COVID19 to account for temporal changes Age sex vaccine type fully boosted status and prior infection before vaccination were included a priori Variations in individual risk over time eg due to receipt of immune suppressive medications were also potentially included The model was developed using data from July 1 2021 through August 31 2022 and prospectively validated on a subsequent second cohort September 1 2022 through August 25 2023 Model performance was quantified by the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve AUC and calibration by Brier score The final model was used to compare observed rates of severe disease to predicted rates among patients who received oral antivirals 216890 SARSCoV2 infections in Veterans not treated with oral antivirals were included median age 65 88 male The development cohort included 165303 patients

million and causing 6 million deaths In an effort to control the spread of the virus governments around the world implemented a variety of measures including stayathome orders school closures and mask mandates These measures had a substantial impact on dietary behavior with individuals discussing more homecooked meals and snacking on social media The study explores pandemicinduced dietary behavior changes using Twitter images and text particularly in relation to obesity to inform interventions and understand societal influences on eating habits Additionally the study investigates the impact of COVID19 on emotions and eating patterns In this study we collected approximately 200000 tweets related to food between May and July in 2019 2020 and 2021 We used transfer learning and a pretrained ResNet101 neural network to classify images into 4 health categories definitely healthy healthy unhealthy and definitely unhealthy We then used the state obesity rates from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System BRFSS to assess the correlation between state obesity rates and dietary images on Twitter The study further investigates the effects of COVID19 on emotional changes and their relation to eating patterns via sentiment analysis Furthermore we illustrated how the popularity of meal terms and health categories changed over time considering varying time zones by incorporating geolocation data A significant correlation was observed between state obesity rates and the percentages of definitely healthy r0360 P01 and definitely unhealthy r0306 P03 food images in 2019 However no trend was observed in 2020 and 2021 despite higher obesity rates A significant P001 increase in the percentage of healthy food consumption was observed during 3999 in 2020 and after the shutdown 3932 in 2021 as compared with the preshutdown period 3769 in 2019 Sentiment analysis from 2019 2020 and 2021 revealed a more positive sentiment associated with dietary posts from 2019 This was the case regardless of the healthiness of the food mentioned in the tweet Last we found a shift in consumption time and an increase in snack consumption during and after the pandemic People ate breakfast later ie from 7 AM to 8 AM in 2019 to 8 AM to 9 AM in 2020 and 2021 and dinner earlier ie from 6 PM to 7 PM in 2019 to 5 PM to 6 PM in 2020 Snacking frequency also increased Taken together dietary behavior shifted toward healthier choices at the population level during and after the COVID19 shutdown with potential for longterm health consequences We were able to observe peoples eating habits using social media data to investigate the effects of COVID19 on dietary behaviors Deep learning for image classification and text analysis was applied revealing a decline in users emotions and a
