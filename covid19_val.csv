40417983,Who Enrolls in Coverage and Who Remains Uninsured Medicaid TakeUp Before and After the Affordable Care Act and During Unwinding,Policy Points The Affordable Care Act ACA dramatically expanded Medicaid eligibility in participating states However many eligible individuals remain uninsured because they do not enroll in or take up coverage The unwinding of the pandemic continuous enrollment provision in 20232024 further raised the importance of this issue After the ACA we found a significant increase in Medicaid takeup among eligible individuals across all eligibility pathways these gains persisted into 2023 which coincided with the beginning of the unwinding However important vulnerabilities in enrollment are still apparent including a steep dropoff in takeup when children become young adults and persistent lower takeup among childless adults and residents of nonexpansion states These findings can guide policies in the postpandemic postACA era and suggest that efforts to reduce outreach or scale back the ACA will threaten coverage for many Medicaid beneficiaries Many uninsured individuals in the United States are eligible for Medicaid but not enrolled The Affordable Care Act ACA expanded Medicaid eligibility starting in 2014 streamlined enrollment and boosted outreach During the 2020 COVID19 pandemic states were required to provide continuous coverage to Medicaid enrollees a policy that ended in April 2023 with resulting coverage losses during the unwinding of this policy Using household data from the American Community Survey and statelevel eligibility criteria we assessed Medicaid participation among US citizens younger than 65 years old who either had Medicaid coverage or no insurance We compared results before the ACA 20082010 after the ACA 20172019 and during unwinding 2023 We utilized logistic regression to identify predictors of takeup in each of these time periods The national takeup rate among Medicaideligible individuals rose from 765 before the ACA to 850 after the ACA These gains persisted in 2023 as unwinding began when takeup was slightly higher 865 than before the pandemic PostACA participation was highest among eligible children Asian American Pacific Islander and Native Hawaiian and Black individuals and residents of expansion states Participation was lowest among adults ages 1921 years old American Indian and Alaska Native AIAN individuals employed adults and those facing premiums for Medicaid coverage Takeup improved postACA in both more and less deprived neighborhoods whereas urban areas saw greater growth in takeup than rural areas From the pre to postACA period Medicaid takeup rates among eligible individuals increased and these gains persisted during the beginning of the unwinding period potentially reflecting increased outreach efforts under the Biden administration However areas of vulnerability remain among young adults working adults AIAN individuals and those in rural areas These findings have important implications as the unwinding period ends and large changes to Medicaid may be considered after the 2024 elections,The Milbank quarterly,2025,"Smith RB, Aboulafia G, Sommers

40261198,Multidisciplinary collaborative guidance on the assessment and treatment of patients with Long COVID A compendium statement,In 2021 the American Academy of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation established the MultiDisciplinary PostAcute Sequelae of SARSCoV2 Infection Collaborative to provide guidance from established Long COVID clinics for the evaluation and management of Long COVID The collaborative previously published eight Long COVID consensus guidance statements using a primarily symptombased approach However Long COVID symptoms most often do not occur in isolation This compendium aims to equip clinicians with an efficient uptodate clinical resource for evaluating and managing adults experiencing Long COVID symptoms The primary intended audience includes physiatrists primary care physicians and other clinicians who provide firstline assessment and management of Long COVID symptoms especially in settings where subspecialty care is not readily available This compendium provides a holistic framework for assessment and management symptomspecific considerations and updates on prevalence health equity disability considerations pathophysiology and emerging evidence regarding treatments under investigation Because Long COVID closely resembles other infectionassociated chronic conditions IACCs such as myalgic encephalomyelitischronic fatigue syndrome the guidance in this compendium may also be helpful for clinicians managing these related conditions Guidance in this compendium was developed by the collaboratives established modified Delphi approach The collaborative is a multidisciplinary group whose members include physiatrists primary care physicians pulmonologists cardiologists psychiatrists neuropsychologists neurologists occupational therapists physical therapists speech and language pathologists patients and government representatives Over 40 Long COVID centers are represented in the collaborative Long COVID is defined by the National Academies of Sciences Engineering and Medicine as an IACC that occurs after SARSCoV2 infection and is present for at least 3 months as a continuous relapsing and remitting or progressive disease state that affects one or more organ systems The current global prevalence of Long COVID is estimated to be 6 Higher prevalence has been identified among female gender certain racial and ethnic groups and individuals who live in nonurban areas However anyone can develop Long COVID after being infected with the SARSCoV2 virus Long COVID can present as a wide variety of symptom clusters The most common symptoms include exaggerated fatigue and diminished energy windows postexertional malaise PEMpostexertional symptom exacerbation PESE cognitive impairment brain fog dysautonomia painmyalgias and smell and taste alterations Holistic assessment should include a traditional history physical examination and additional diagnostic testing as indicated A positive COVID19 test during acute SARSCoV2 infection is not required to diagnose Long COVID and currently there is no single laboratory finding that is definitively diagnostic for confirming or ruling out the diagnosis of Long COVID A basic laboratory assessment is recommended for all patients with possible Long COVID and consideration for additional labs and diagnostic procedures is guided by the patients specific symptoms Current management strategies focus on symptombased supportive care Critical considerations include energy conservation strategies and addressing comorbidities and modifiable risk factors Additionally 1 it is essential to validate the patients experience and provide reassurance that their symptoms are being taken seriously because many patients have had their symptoms dismissed by loved ones and clinicians 2 physical activity recommendations must be carefully tailored to the patients current activity tolerance because overly intense activity can trigger PEMPESE and worsened muscle damage and 3 treatment recommendations should be delivered with humility because there are many persistent unknowns related to Long COVID To date there are limited data to guide medication management specifically in the context of Long COVID As such medication use generally follows standard practice regarding indications and dosing with extra attention to prioritize 1 patient preference via shared decisionmaking and 2 cautious use of medications that may improve some symptoms eg cognitiveattention impairment but may worsen other symptoms eg PEMPESE Numerous clinical trials are investigating additional treatments The returntowork process for individuals with Long COVID can be challenging because symptoms can fluctuate vary in nature affect multiple functional areas eg physical and cognitive and often manifest as an invisible disability that may not be readily acknowledged by employers or coworkers Clinicians can help patients return to work by identifying suitable workplace accommodations and resources providing necessary documentation and recommending occupational or vocational therapy when needed If these efforts are unsuccessful and work significantly worsens Long COVID symptoms or impedes recovery applying for disability may be warranted Long COVID is recognized as a potential disability under the Americans with Disabilities Act To contribute to the overall health and wellbeing for all patients Long COVID care should be delivered in a holistic manner that acknowledges challenges faced by the patient and uncertainties in the field For more

40070694,Leveraging nearrealtime patient and population data to incorporate fluctuating risk of severe COVID19 development and prospective validation of a personalised risk prediction tool,Novel strategies that account for populationlevel changes in dominant variants immunity testing practices and changes in individual risk profiles are needed to identify patients who remain at high risk of severe COVID19 The aim of this study was to develop and prospectively validate a tool to predict absolute risk of severe COVID19 incorporating dynamic parameters at the patient and population levels that could be used to inform clinical care A retrospective cohort of vaccinated US Veterans with SARSCoV2 from July 1 2021 through August 25 2023 was created Models were estimated using logisticregressionbased machine learning with backward selection and included a variable with fluctuating absolute risk of severe COVID19 to account for temporal changes Age sex vaccine type fully boosted status and prior infection before vaccination were included a priori Variations in individual risk over time eg due to receipt of immune suppressive medications were also potentially included The model was developed using data from July 1 2021 through August 31 2022 and prospectively validated on a subsequent second cohort September 1 2022 through August 25 2023 Model performance was quantified by the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve AUC and calibration by Brier score The final model was used to compare observed rates of severe disease to predicted rates among patients who received oral antivirals 216890 SARSCoV2 infections in Veterans not treated with oral antivirals were included median age 65 88 male The development cohort included 165303 patients 66121 in the training set 49591 in the tuning set and 49591 in the testing set and the prospective validation cohort included 51587 patients The percentage of severe infections ranged from 5 to 25 Model performance improved until 24 clinical predictor variables including age comorbidities and immunesuppressive medications plus a 30day rolling risk window were included AUC in development cohort

pulmonary disease Alzheimers disease heart failure and anaemia Glucocorticoid use during the onemonth prior to COVID19 diagnosis was the next most important predictor Models that included a nearreal time fluctuating population risk variable performed better than models stratified by circulating variant and models with dominant variant included as a predictor Patients with predicted severe disease risk 3 who received oral antivirals had approximately 4fold lower rates of severe COVID19 untreated patients at a similar risk level Our novel risk prediction tool uses a simple method to adjust for

40005554,How Does VaccineInduced Immunity Compare to InfectionAcquired Immunity in the Dynamics of COVID19,Five years into the COVID19 pandemic the availability of effective vaccines has substantially reduced new cases hospitalizations and mortality However the waning of immunity has been a topic of particular interest in relation to disease control The objective of this study is to investigate the impact of the decline in vaccineinduced immunity 1 and infectionacquired immunity 2 on disease dynamics For this purpose we use a compartmental model with seven compartments that accounts for differential morbidity vaccination and waning immunity A compartmental model divides a population into distinct groups depending on their disease status The temporal changes in the compartments are represented through ordinary differential equations ODEs The model is mathematically analyzed to show that a backward bifurcation ie a perverse outcome may occur when the vaccinated reproduction number Rv is equal to unity Both local and global sensitivity analysis on the reproduction number reveal that the vaccine efficacy waning of vaccineinduced immunity vaccine coverage rate coefficients of transmissibility and the recovery rate for mild infections are the most sensitive parameters The global sensitivity analysis on the cumulative number of infections shows that 1 and 2 are both pivotal parameters while 2 has a higher influence Simulations on infections and mortality suggest that the changes in 2 result in dynamics that are more pronounced compared to the dynamics resulting from the changes in 1 thus indicating the importance of the duration of infectionacquired immunity in disease spread,"Pathogens (Basel, Switzerland)",2025,"Hewage IM, Hull-Nye D, Schwartz EJ",10.3390/pathogens14020179,A,five years covid19 pandemic availability effective vaccines substantially reduced new cases hospitalizations mortality however waning immunity topic particular interest relation disease control objective study investigate impact decline vaccineinduced immunity 1 infectionacquired immunity 2 disease dynamics purpose use compartmental model seven compartments accounts differential morbidity vaccination waning immunity compartmental model divides population distinct groups depending disease status temporal changes compartments represented ordinary differential equations odes model mathematically analyzed show backward bifurcation ie perverse outcome may occur vaccinated reproduction number rv equal unity local global sensitivity analysis reproduction number reveal vaccine efficacy waning vaccineinduced immunity vaccine coverage rate coefficients transmissibility recovery rate,vaccineinduced immunity compare infectionacquired immunity dynamics covid19,vaccineinduced immunity compare infectionacquired immunity dynamics covid19 five years covid19 pandemic availability effective vaccines substantially reduced new cases hospitalizations mortality however waning immunity topic particular interest relation disease control objective study investigate impact decline vaccineinduced immunity 1 infectionacquired immunity 2 disease dynamics purpose use compartmental model seven compartments accounts differential morbidity vaccination waning immunity compartmental model divides population distinct groups depending disease status temporal changes compartments represented ordinary differential equations odes model mathematically analyzed show backward bifurcation ie perverse outcome may occur vaccinated reproduction number rv equal unity local global sensitivity analysis reproduction number reveal vaccine efficacy waning vaccineinduced immunity vaccine coverage rate coefficients transmissibility recovery rate
39977859,Leveraging Large Language Models for Infectious Disease SurveillanceUsing a Web Service for Monitoring COVID19 Patterns From SelfReporting Tweets Content Analysis,The emergence of new SARSCoV2 variants the resulting reinfections and postCOVID19 condition continue to impact many peoples lives Tracking websites like the one at Johns Hopkins University no longer report the daily confirmed cases posing challenges to accurately determine the true extent of infections Many COVID19 cases with mild symptoms are selfassessed at home and reported on social media which provides an opportunity to monitor and understand the progression and evolving trends of the disease We aim to build a publicly available database of COVID19related tweets and extracted information about symptoms and recovery cycles from selfreported tweets We have presented the results of our analysis of infection reinfection recovery and longterm effects of COVID19 on a visualization website that refreshes data on a weekly basis We used Twitter subsequently rebranded as X to collect COVID19related data from which 9 native Englishspeaking annotators annotated a training dataset of COVID19positive selfreporters We then used large language models to identify positive selfreporters from other unannotated tweets We used the Hibert transform to calculate the lead of the prediction curve ahead of the reported curve Finally we presented our findings on symptoms recovery reinfections and longterm effects of COVID19 on the Covlab website We collected 73 million tweets related to COVID19 between January 1 2020 and April 1 2024 including 262278 selfreported cases The predicted number of infection cases by our model is 763 days ahead of the official report In addition to common symptoms we identified some symptoms that were not included in the list from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention such as lethargy and hallucinations Repeat infections were commonly occurring with rates of second and third infections at 749 19644262278 and 137 3593262278 respectively whereas 045 1180262278 also reported that they had been infected 5 times We identified 723 individuals who shared detailed recovery experiences through tweets indicating a substantially reduction in recovery time over the years Specifically the average recovery period decreased from around 30 days in 2020 to approximately 12 days in 2023 In addition geographic information collected from confirmed individuals indicates that the temporal patterns of confirmed cases in states such as California and Texas closely mirror the overall trajectory observed across the United States Although with some biases and limitations selfreported tweet data serves as a valuable complement to clinical data especially in the postpandemic era dominated by mild cases Our webbased analytic platform can play a significant role in continuously tracking COVID19 finding new uncommon symptoms detecting and monitoring the
