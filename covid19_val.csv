40261198,Multidisciplinary collaborative guidance on the assessment and treatment of patients with Long COVID A compendium statement,In 2021 the American Academy of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation established the MultiDisciplinary PostAcute Sequelae of SARSCoV2 Infection Collaborative to provide guidance from established Long COVID clinics for the evaluation and management of Long COVID The collaborative previously published eight Long COVID consensus guidance statements using a primarily symptombased approach However Long COVID symptoms most often do not occur in isolation This compendium aims to equip clinicians with an efficient uptodate clinical resource for evaluating and managing adults experiencing Long COVID symptoms The primary intended audience includes physiatrists primary care physicians and other clinicians who provide firstline assessment and management of Long COVID symptoms especially in settings where subspecialty care is not readily available This compendium provides a holistic framework for assessment and management symptomspecific considerations and updates on prevalence health equity disability considerations pathophysiology and emerging evidence regarding treatments under investigation Because Long COVID closely resembles other infectionassociated chronic conditions IACCs such as myalgic encephalomyelitischronic fatigue syndrome the guidance in this compendium may also be helpful for clinicians managing these related conditions Guidance in this compendium was developed by the collaboratives established modified Delphi approach The collaborative is a multidisciplinary group whose members include physiatrists primary care physicians pulmonologists cardiologists psychiatrists neuropsychologists neurologists occupational therapists physical therapists speech and language pathologists patients and government representatives Over 40 Long COVID centers are represented in the collaborative Long COVID is defined by the National Academies of Sciences Engineering and Medicine as an IACC that occurs after SARSCoV2 infection and is present for at least 3 months as a continuous relapsing and remitting or progressive disease state that affects one or more organ systems The current global prevalence of Long COVID is estimated to be 6 Higher prevalence has been identified among female gender certain racial and ethnic groups and individuals who live in nonurban areas However anyone can develop Long COVID after being infected with the SARSCoV2 virus Long COVID can present as a wide variety of symptom clusters The most common symptoms include exaggerated fatigue and diminished energy windows postexertional malaise PEMpostexertional symptom exacerbation PESE cognitive impairment brain fog dysautonomia painmyalgias and smell and taste alterations Holistic assessment should include a traditional history physical examination and additional diagnostic testing as indicated A positive COVID19 test during acute SARSCoV2 infection is not required to diagnose Long COVID and currently there is no single laboratory finding that is definitively diagnostic for confirming or ruling out the diagnosis of Long COVID A basic laboratory assessment is recommended for all patients with possible Long COVID and consideration for additional labs and diagnostic procedures is guided by the patients specific symptoms Current management strategies focus on symptombased supportive care Critical considerations include energy conservation strategies and addressing comorbidities and modifiable risk factors Additionally 1 it is essential to validate the patients experience and provide reassurance that their symptoms are being taken seriously because many patients have had their symptoms dismissed by loved ones and clinicians 2 physical activity recommendations must be carefully tailored to the patients current activity tolerance because overly intense activity can trigger PEMPESE and worsened muscle damage and 3 treatment recommendations should be delivered with humility because there are many persistent unknowns related to Long COVID To date there are limited data to guide medication management specifically in the context of Long COVID As such medication use generally follows standard practice regarding indications and dosing with extra attention to prioritize 1 patient preference via shared decisionmaking and 2 cautious use of medications that may improve some symptoms eg cognitiveattention impairment but may worsen other symptoms eg PEMPESE Numerous clinical trials are investigating additional treatments The returntowork process for individuals with Long COVID can be challenging because symptoms can fluctuate vary in nature affect multiple functional areas eg physical and cognitive and often manifest as an invisible disability that may not be readily acknowledged by employers or coworkers Clinicians can help patients return to work by identifying suitable workplace accommodations and resources providing necessary documentation and recommending occupational or vocational therapy when needed If these efforts are unsuccessful and work significantly worsens Long COVID symptoms or impedes recovery applying for disability may be warranted Long COVID is recognized as a potential disability under the Americans with Disabilities Act To contribute to the overall health and wellbeing for all patients Long COVID care should be delivered in a holistic manner that acknowledges challenges faced by the patient and uncertainties in the field For more
