40146990,Generative Large Language ModelPowered Conversational AI App for Personalized Risk Assessment Case Study in COVID19,Large language models LLMs have demonstrated powerful capabilities in natural language tasks and are increasingly being integrated into health care for tasks like disease risk assessment Traditional machine learning methods rely on structured data and coding limiting their flexibility in dynamic clinical environments This study presents a novel approach to disease risk assessment using generative LLMs through conversational artificial intelligence AI eliminating the need for programming This study evaluates the use of pretrained generative LLMs including LLaMA27b and FlanT5xl for COVID19 severity prediction with the goal of enabling a realtime nocode risk assessment solution through chatbotbased questionanswering interactions To contextualize their performance we compare LLMs with traditional machine learning classifiers such as logistic regression extreme gradient boosting XGBoost and random forest which rely on tabular data We finetuned LLMs using fewshot natural language examples from a dataset of 393 pediatric patients developing a mobile app that integrates these models to provide realtime nocode COVID19 severity risk assessment through clinicianpatient interaction The LLMs were compared with traditional classifiers across different experimental settings using the area under the curve AUC as the primary evaluation metric Feature importance derived from LLM attention layers was also analyzed to enhance interpretability Generative LLMs demonstrated strong performance in lowdata settings In zeroshot scenarios the T03bT model achieved an AUC of 075 while other LLMs such as T0pp8bitT and FlanT5xlT reached 067 and 069 respectively At 2shot settings logistic regression and random forest achieved an AUC of 057 while FlanT5xlT and T03bT obtained 069 and 065 respectively By 32shot settings FlanT5xlT reached 070 similar to logistic regression 069 and random forest 068 while XGBoost improved to 065 These results illustrate the differences in how generative LLMs and traditional models handle the increasing data availability LLMs perform well in lowdata scenarios whereas traditional models rely more on structured tabular data and labeled training examples Furthermore the mobile app provides realtime COVID19 severity assessments and personalized insights through attentionbased feature importance adding value to the clinical interpretation of the results Generative LLMs provide a robust alternative to traditional classifiers particularly in scenarios with limited labeled data Their ability to handle unstructured inputs and deliver personalized realtime assessments without coding makes them highly adaptable to

39772174,Integrating Interpretability in Machine Learning and Deep Neural Networks A Novel Approach to Feature Importance and Outlier Detection in COVID19 Symptomatology and Vaccine Efficacy,In this study we introduce a novel approach that integrates interpretability techniques from both traditional machine learning ML and deep neural networks DNN to quantify feature importance using global and local interpretation methods Our method bridges the gap between interpretable ML models and powerful deep learning DL architectures providing comprehensive insights into the key drivers behind model predictions especially in detecting outliers within medical data We applied this method to analyze COVID19 pandemic data from 2020 yielding intriguing insights We used a dataset consisting of individuals who were tested for COVID19 during the early stages of the pandemic in 2020 The dataset included selfreported symptoms and test results from a wide demographic and our goal was to identify the most important symptoms that could help predict COVID19 infection accurately By applying interpretability techniques to both machine learning and deep learning models we aimed to improve understanding of symptomatology and enhance early detection of COVID19 cases Notably even though less than 1 of our cohort reported having a sore throat this symptom emerged as a significant indicator of active COVID19 infection appearing 7 out of 9 times in the top four most important features across all methodologies This suggests its potential as an early symptom marker Studies have shown that individuals reporting sore throat may have a compromised immune system where antibody generation is not functioning correctly This aligns with our data which indicates that 5 of patients with sore throats required hospitalization Our analysis also revealed a concerning trend of diminished immune response postCOVID infection increasing the likelihood of severe cases requiring hospitalization This finding underscores the importance of monitoring patients postrecovery for potential complications and tailoring medical interventions accordingly Our study also raises critical questions about the efficacy of COVID19 vaccines in individuals presenting with sore throat as a symptom The results suggest that booster shots might be necessary for this population to ensure adequate immunity given the observed immune response patterns The proposed method not only enhances our understanding of COVID19 symptomatology but also demonstrates its broader utility in medical outlier detection This research contributes valuable insights to ongoing efforts in creating interpretable models for COVID19 management and vaccine optimization strategies By leveraging feature importance and interpretability these models empower physicians healthcare workers and researchers to understand complex relationships within medical data facilitating more informed decisionmaking for patient care

40397945,Identifying Disinformation on the Extended Impacts of COVID19 Methodological Investigation Using a Fuzzy Ranking Ensemble of Natural Language Processing Models,During the COVID19 pandemic the continuous spread of misinformation on the internet posed an ongoing threat to public trust and understanding of epidemic prevention policies Although the pandemic is now under control information regarding the risks of longterm COVID19 effects and reinfection still needs to be integrated into COVID19 policies This study aims to develop a robust and generalizable deep learning framework for detecting misinformation related to the prolonged impacts of COVID19 by integrating pretrained language models PLMs with an innovative fuzzy rankbased ensemble approach A comprehensive dataset comprising 566 genuine and 2361 fake samples was curated from reliable open sources and processed using advanced techniques The dataset was randomly split using the scikitlearn package to facilitate both training and evaluation Deep learning models were trained for 20 epochs on a Tesla T4 for hierarchical attention networks HANs and an RTX A5000 for the other models To enhance performance we implemented an ensemble learning strategy that incorporated a reparameterized Gompertz function which assigned fuzzy ranks based on each models prediction confidence for each test case This method effectively fused outputs from stateoftheart PLMs such as robustly optimized bidirectional encoder representations from transformers pretraining approach RoBERTa decodingenhanced bidirectional encoder representations from transformers with disentangled attention DeBERTa and XLNet After training on the dataset various classification methods were evaluated on the test set including the fuzzy rankbased method and stateoftheart large language models Experimental results reveal that language models particularly XLNet outperform traditional approaches that combine term frequencyinverse document frequency features with support vector machine or utilize deep models like HAN The evaluation metricsincluding accuracy precision recall F1score and area under the curve AUCindicated a clear performance advantage for models that had a larger number of parameters However this study also highlights that model architecture training procedures and optimization techniques are critical determinants of classification effectiveness XLNets permutation language modeling approach enhances bidirectional context understanding allowing it to surpass even larger models in the bidirectional encoder representations from transformers BERT series despite having relatively fewer parameters Notably the fuzzy rankbased ensemble method which combines multiple language models achieved impressive results on the test set with an accuracy of 9352 a precision of 9465 an F1score of 9603 and an AUC of 9715 The fusion of ensemble learning with PLMs and the Gompertz function employing fuzzy rankbased methodology introduces a novel prediction approach with prospects for enhancing accuracy and reliability Additionally the experimental results imply that training solely on textual content can yield high prediction accuracy thereby providing valuable insights into the optimization of fake news detection systems These findings not only aid in detecting misinformation but also have broader implications for the application of advanced deep learning techniques in public health policy and communication,Journal of medical Internet research,2025,"Chen JA, Chung WC, Hung

to postpartum family planning in Amhara Ethiopia a qualitative study,Poor mental health can negatively impact health outcomes across diverse health areas including in the first year postpartum Yet the intersection of postpartum mental health and postpartum family planning FP is understudied Cognitive Behavioral Therapy CBT is an evidencebased practice that has proven helpful for improving mental health and supporting positive behavior change across health areas including in lowresource settings Drawing on existing CBT tools we created and piloted an intervention called Mothers Time designed to be delivered in three sessions by a community health worker CHW to small groups of postpartum women experiencing depression or anxiety symptoms and an unmet need for FP Our objective was to assess the feasibility and acceptability of Mothers Time in rural Amhara Ethiopia We recruited and trained four CHWs to deliver the intervention We recruited 16 postpartum women experiencing mild to moderate anxiety and depressive symptoms to participate We conducted indepth interviews with women and CHWs before during and after the intervention We used a framework approach to analyze data To assess acceptability we analyzed data from mothers probing to understand whether they found the intervention accessible engaging and relevant for the challenges they were experiencing postpartum To assess feasibility we explored CHWs ability to deliver the intervention and analyzed their capacity to deliver it at consistent quality Interviews with CHWs and other health actors provided additional data on the feasibility of adding simplified CBT to CHWs current package of services Mothers perceived Mothers Time to be acceptable and to provide helpful tools for navigating the postpartum period Prior to the intervention many women felt isolated and the group sessions supported social connection Vignettes demonstrating simple CBT concepts engaged mothers provoking reflection on how anxious or sad thoughts can impact behaviors that are important for informed FP use such as care seeking spousal communication and planning for the future and sparked discussions on how mothers can support their own mental and physical health Homework explained by CHW in sessions and completed independently between sessions helped women prioritize caring for themselves and social connection Overall we found that it was feasible for CHW to learn and deliver Mothers Time CHW understood that mental health could create challenges for mothers and were able to use the simplified materials to share information about basic mental health concepts Limited time was the biggest challenge CHWs would benefit from additional training and women would likely benefit from additional sessions This research may be useful to

million and causing 6 million deaths In an effort to control the spread of the virus governments around the world implemented a variety of measures including stayathome orders school closures and mask mandates These measures had a substantial impact on dietary behavior with individuals discussing more homecooked meals and snacking on social media The study explores pandemicinduced dietary behavior changes using Twitter images and text particularly in relation to obesity to inform interventions and understand societal influences on eating habits Additionally the study investigates the impact of COVID19 on emotions and eating patterns In this study we collected approximately 200000 tweets related to food between May and July in 2019 2020 and 2021 We used transfer learning and a pretrained ResNet101 neural network to classify images into 4 health categories definitely healthy healthy unhealthy and definitely unhealthy We then used the state obesity rates from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System BRFSS to assess the correlation between state obesity rates and dietary images on Twitter The study further investigates the effects of COVID19 on emotional changes and their relation to eating patterns via sentiment analysis Furthermore we illustrated how the popularity of meal terms and health categories changed over time considering varying time zones by incorporating geolocation data A significant correlation was observed between state obesity rates and the percentages of definitely healthy r0360 P01 and definitely unhealthy r0306 P03 food images in 2019 However no trend was observed in 2020 and 2021 despite higher obesity rates A significant P001 increase in the percentage of healthy food consumption was observed during 3999 in 2020 and after the shutdown 3932 in 2021 as compared with the preshutdown period 3769 in 2019 Sentiment analysis from 2019 2020 and 2021 revealed a more positive sentiment associated with dietary posts from 2019 This was the case regardless of the healthiness of the food mentioned in the tweet Last we found a shift in consumption time and an increase in snack consumption during and after the pandemic People ate breakfast later ie from 7 AM to 8 AM in 2019 to 8 AM to 9 AM in 2020 and 2021 and dinner earlier ie from 6 PM to 7 PM in 2019 to 5 PM to 6 PM in 2020 Snacking frequency also increased Taken together dietary behavior shifted toward healthier choices at the population level during and after the COVID19 shutdown with potential for longterm health consequences We were able to observe peoples eating habits

40146993,An ensemble approach improves the prediction of the COVID19 pandemic in South Korea,Modelling can contribute to disease prevention and control strategies Accurate predictions of future cases and mortality rates were essential for establishing appropriate policies during the COVID19 pandemic However no single model yielded definite conclusions with each having specific strengths and weaknesses Here we propose an ensemble learning approach which can offset the limitations of each model and improve prediction performances We generated predictions for the transmission and impact of COVID19 in South Korea using seven individual models including mathematical statistical and machine learning approaches We integrated these predictions using three ensemble methods stacking average and weighted average ensemble WAE We used train and test errors to measure a models performance and selected the best covariate combinations based on the lowest train error We then evaluated model performance using five error measures r2 weighted mean absolute percentage error WMAPE autoregressive integrated moving average ARIMA mean squared error MSE root mean squared error RMSE and mean absolute percentage error MAPE and selected the optimal covariate combination accordingly To validate the generalisability of our approach we applied the same modelling framework to USA data Booster shot rate  Omicron variant BA5 rate was the most commonly selected combination of covariates For raw data evaluated using the WMAPE individual models achieved the following Generalised additive modelling GAM reached a value of 0244 for the daily number of confirmed cases a value of 0172 for the time series Poisson for the daily number of confirmed deaths and a value of 0022 for both ARIMA and time series Poisson for the daily number of ICU patients For smoothed data the HoltWinters model achieved a value of 0058 for daily confirmed cases while ARIMA attained a value of 0058 for the daily number of confirmed deaths and 0013 for the daily number of ICU patients Among ensemble models the SVMbased stacking ensemble achieved error values of 0235 for the daily number of confirmed cases 0118 for the daily number of deaths and 0019 for the daily number of ICU patients on raw data For smoothed data the average ensemble and weighted average ensemble achieved 0060 for the daily number of confirmed cases and 0013 for daily ICU patients The ensemble models also generalised well when applied to data from the USABooster shot rate  Omicron variant BA5 rate was the most commonly selected combination of covariates For raw data GAM 0244 predicted daily confirmed cases best time series Poisson 0172 predicted daily confirmed deaths and both ARIMA and time series Poisson 0022 predicted daily ICU patients based on WMAPE For smoothed data time series Poisson predicted daily confirmed cases 0065 best while ARIMA best predicted daily confirmed deaths 0058 and ICU patients 0013

models for predicting daily confirmed cases 0058 and ICU patients 0011 The performance of ensemble models was generalised to other countries using the USA data for predictive performance No single model performed consistently While the ensemble models did not always provide the best predictions a comparison of firstbest and secondbest models showed that they performed considerably better than the single models If an ensemble model was not the best performing model its performance was always not far from the best single model a look at the mean and variance of the error measures shows that ensemble models provided stable predictions without much variation in their performances compared to single models These results can be used to inform policymaking during future pandemics,Journal of

Transformation Programme The COVID19 pandemic led to an acceleration of digital innovation in particular the use of digital clinical consultations telephonevideo consultations The ways in which digital clinical consultations can be optimised and utilised alongside the traditional maternity care pathway remains unclear however with particular concerns about the potential for digital care to exacerbate inequalities To explore how digital clinical consultations can be implemented in a clinically safe appropriate and acceptable way within UK maternity services For whom In what settings And for what purposes A realist synthesis combining an evidence review of diverse sources 2010 to the present from Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development countries with insights from key stakeholder groups healthcare professionals service users and community organisations There were three main sources 1 published primary and secondary research 2 grey literature such as policy documents and maternity safety reports and 3 stakeholder insights A realist synthesis adopts a theorydriven approach which seeks to understand how a complex programme works for whom and under what circumstances The review had three iterative phases 1 refining the review focus and developing initial programme theories 2 retrieval of evidence for data extraction and analysis using on a realist logic to identify key contexts mechanisms and outcomes and 3 testing and refining the programme theories The final synthesis included 93 evidence sources reviews reports and 77 primary studies with priority given to UKfocused studies Study samples included a focus on healthcare professionals n  17 women n  45 of which 14 focused on vulnerable groups or both n  15 Clinical and safetyrelated outcomes were reported in 12 studies Fifteen programme theories were developed A conceptual framework was produced that illustrates the interrelationship between key contexts in maternity care through which different interactions activate mechanisms to produce outcomes of interest The findings suggest that digital clinical consultations can be acceptable and appropriate if implementation includes personalisation and informed choice for women as well as support and autonomy for staff The relationship and connection between women and their healthcare professional are proposed as key mechanisms that support safety and engagement in care Some of the evidence lacked details regarding specific settings interventions or sample characteristics This limits the extent to which findings can be applied to microlevel contexts Stakeholder groups contributed key insights to the review at all stages In spite of efforts to achieve diversity within these groups there may have been experiences or identities that were missed Four CORE implementation principles were identified to guide future practice and research C  Creating the right environment infrastructure and support for staff O  Optimising consultations to be responsive flexible and personalised to different needs and preferences R  Recognising the importance of access and inclusion and E  Enabling quality and safety through relationshipfocused connections Future research should embed equity considerations and should focus on understanding digital clinical consultation within specific maternity systems like

indicated that coDEGs were significantly enriched in immune inflammatory responses related to leukocytes and neutrophils Immune infiltration analysis revealed significant differences in immune cell populations between the disease group and the normal group Finally genes selected through machine learning methods included CLEC4E S100A12 and IL1R2 Based on the PPI network the top ten most influential DEGs were identified as MMP9 TLR2 TLR4 ITGAM S100A12 FCGR1A CD163 FCER1G FPR2 and CLEC4D The integration of the proteinprotein interaction PPI network with machine learning techniques facilitated the identification of S100A12 as a potential common biomarker for early diagnosis and a therapeutic target for all three diseases Ultimately validation of S100A12 showed that it was consistent with our experimental results confirming its reliability as a biomarker Moreover it demonstrated good diagnostic performance for the three diseases We employed bioinformatics methods and machine learning to investigate common diagnostic biomarkers and immune infiltration characteristics of COVID19 AMI and AIS Functional and pathway analyses indicated that the coDEGs were primarily enriched in immune inflammatory responses related to leukocytes and neutrophils Through two machine learning approaches and the PPI network and subsequent validation and evaluation we identified S100A12 as a potential common therapeutic target and biomarker related to immune response that may influence these three diseases,BMC neurology,2025,"Ma YN, Ma SR, Yang

continuous spread of misinformation on the internet posed an ongoing threat to public trust and understanding of epidemic prevention policies Although the pandemic is now under control information regarding the risks of longterm COVID19 effects and reinfection still needs to be integrated into COVID19 policies This study aims to develop a robust and generalizable deep learning framework for detecting misinformation related to the prolonged impacts of COVID19 by integrating pretrained language models PLMs with an innovative fuzzy rankbased ensemble approach A comprehensive dataset comprising 566 genuine and 2361 fake samples was curated from reliable open sources and processed using advanced techniques The dataset was randomly split using the scikitlearn package to facilitate both training and evaluation Deep learning models were trained for 20 epochs on a Tesla T4 for hierarchical attention networks HANs and an RTX A5000 for the other models To enhance performance we implemented an ensemble learning strategy that incorporated a reparameterized Gompertz function which assigned fuzzy ranks based on each models prediction confidence for each test case This method

document frequency features with support vector machine or utilize deep models like HAN The evaluation metricsincluding accuracy precision recall F1score and area under the curve AUCindicated a clear performance advantage for models that had a larger number of parameters However this study also highlights that model architecture training procedures and optimization techniques are critical determinants of classification effectiveness XLNets permutation language modeling approach enhances bidirectional context understanding allowing it to surpass even larger models in the bidirectional

40266230,Robust COVID19 Vaccine Responses Despite Filarial CoInfection Insights from a Lymphatic Filariasis Cohort in Ghana,Although the COVID19 pandemic has largely concluded the varied trajectories it has followed in different regions of the world remain incompletely understood Intensive research is needed to fully grasp its course and the implications for future global health challenges Notably the milder trajectory of the COVID19 pandemic in SubSaharan Africa has defied initial predictions An emerging body of evidence suggests that in addition to the continents younger average age and the lower prevalence of relevant comorbidities coinfections with helminths may have also impressively shaped the pandemics milder trajectory in the region Indeed helminths are renowned for their ability to modulate human immune responses which while potentially beneficial in limiting excessive inflammation could also diminish vaccine efficacy and impede viral clearance This study investigated different aspects of the intricate interactions between COVID19 and Lymphatic Filariasis LF a helminth infection caused by parasitic worms such as Wuchereria bancrofti Brugia malayi and Brugia timori

MannWhitney U tests The results indicate that a remarkable portion of unvaccinated individuals 56 IgA seropositive 39 IgG seropositive developed antibodies against SARSCoV2 despite no confirmed infection Notably the study identified a robust antibody response to COVID19 vaccination which was independent of the degree of LF pathology or parasitic status An important observation was the reduced SARSCoV2 antibody response in individuals seropositive for Ascaris lumbricoides p  00264 highlighting an interaction between roundworm infection and COVID19 The study concludes that the ChAdOx1S COVID19 vaccine AstraZeneca triggers a strong immune response in LF patients however filarial andor soiltransmitted helminth seropositivity might influence the COVID19 infectioninduced

39557769,Identification of Novel Genomic Variants in COVID19 Patients Using WholeExome Sequencing Exploring the Plausible Targets of Functional Genomics,Covid19 caused by SARSCoV2 virus has emerged as an immense burden and an unparalleled global health challenge in recorded human history The clinical characteristics and risk factors of COVID19 exhibit considerable variability leading to a spectrum of clinical severity Moreover the likelihood of exposure to the virus may differ based on comorbidity status as comorbid illnesses have mechanisms that can considerably increase mortality by reducing the bodys ability to withstand injury The mammalian target of rapamycin mTOR pathway is essential for orchestrating innate immune cell defense including cytokine production and is dysregulated in severe Coronavirus Disease 2019 COVID19 individuals Through genomewide association studies numerous genetic variants in the human host have been identified that have a significant impact on the immune response to SARSCoV2 To identify potentially significant genetic variants in Covid19 patients that could affect the risk severity and clinical outcome of the infection this study has used wholeexome sequencing WES on the 16 COVID19 patients with varying comorbidities and severity of the disease including fatal outcomes Among them 8 patients made a full recovery and were discharged while 8 patients unfortunately did not survive due to the severity of the illness and majority of them were males The study identified 10204 variants in the patients From 1120 variants which were chosen for novel variant analysis using mutation function prediction tools to identify deleterious variants that could affect normal gene function 116 variants of 57 genes were found to be deleterious These variants were further classified as likely pathogenic and variants of uncertain significance The data showed that among the likely pathogenic variants five genes were identified in connection to immune response whereas two were related to respiratory system The common variants associated with the covid19 phenotype showed the top 10 significant genes identified in this study such as ERCC2 FBXO5 HTR3D FAIM DNAH17 MTOR IGHMBP2 ZNF530 QSER1 and FOXRED2 with variant rs1057079 of the MTOR gene representing the highest odds ratio 17 p  87e04 The mammalian target of rapamycin mTOR pathway variant rs1057079 was reported with high odds ratio may orchestrate innate immune cell defense including cytokine production and is dysregulated This study concluded that the mTOR signaling gene variant rs1057079 is associated with different degrees of covid19 severity and is essential for orchestrating innate immune cell defense including cytokine production Inhibiting mTOR and its corresponding deleterious immune responses with medicinal approaches may provide a novel avenue for treating severe COVID19 illness Besides the PPI network exhibited a significantly high local

psychosocial burdens on pregnant individuals As there is less evidence about the experience and management of psychosocial burdens of diabetes mellitus during pregnancy we sought to identify these psychosocial burdens and understand how a novel smartphone app may alleviate them The app was designed to provide supportive educational motivational and logistical support content delivered through interactive messages The study aimed to analyze the qualitative data generated in a feasibility randomized controlled trial of a novel mobile app designed to promote selfmanagement skills motivate healthy behaviors and inform lowincome pregnant individuals with diabetes Individuals receiving routine clinical care at a single large academic medical center in Chicago Illinois were randomized to use of the SweetMama app n30 or usual care n10 from diagnosis of diabetes until 6 weeks post partum All individuals completed exit interviews at delivery about their experience of having diabetes during pregnancy Interviews were guided by a semistructured interview guide and were conducted by a single interviewer extensively trained in empathic culturally sensitive qualitative interviewing of pregnant and postpartum people SweetMama users were also queried about their perspectives on the app Interview data were audiorecorded and professionally transcribed Data were analyzed by 2 researchers independently using grounded theory constant comparative techniques Of the 40 participants the majority had gestational diabetes mellitus n25 63 publicly funded prenatal care n33 83 and identified as nonHispanic Black n25 63 or Hispanic n14 35 Participants identified multiple psychosocial burdens including challenges taking action negative affectivity regarding diagnosis diet guilt difficulties managing other responsibilities and reluctance to use insulin External factors such as taking care of children or navigating the COVID19 pandemic affected participant selfperception and motivation to adhere to clinical recommendations SweetMama participants largely agreed that the use of the app helped mitigate these burdens by enhancing selfefficacy capitalizing on external motivation validating efforts maintaining medical nutrition therapy extending clinical care and building a sense of community Participants expressed that SweetMama supported the goals they established with their clinical team and helped them harness motivating factors for selfcare Psychosocial burdens of diabetes during pregnancy present challenges with diabetes selfmanagement Mobile health support

40340717,Reproducibility of genetic risk factors identified for long COVID using combinatorial analysis across US and UK patient cohorts with diverse ancestries,Long COVID is a major public health burden causing a diverse array of debilitating symptoms in tens of millions of patients globally In spite of this overwhelming disease prevalence staggering cost severe impact on patients lives and intense global research efforts study of the disease has proved challenging due to its complexity Genomewide association studies GWAS have identified only four loci potentially associated with the disease although these results did not statistically replicate between studies A previous combinatorial analysis study identified a total of 73 genes that were highly associated with two long COVID cohorts in the predominantly  91 white European ancestry Sano GOLD population and we sought to reproduce these findings in the independent and ancestrally more diverse All of Us AoU population We assessed the reproducibility of the 5343 long COVID disease signatures from the original study in the AoU population Because the very small population sizes provide very limited power to replicate findings we initially tested whether we observed a statistically significant enrichment of the Sano GOLD disease signatures that are also positively correlated with long COVID in the AoU cohort after controlling for population substructure For the Sano GOLD disease signatures that have a case frequency greater than 5 in AoU we consistently observed a significant enrichment 7783 p  001 of signatures that are also positively associated with long COVID in the AoU cohort These encompassed 92 of the genes identified in the original study At least five of the disease signatures found in Sano GOLD were also shown to be individually significantly associated with increased long COVID prevalence in the AoU population Rates of signature reproducibility are strongest among selfidentified white patients but we also observe significant enrichment of reproducing disease associations in selfidentified blackAfricanAmerican and HispanicLatino cohorts Signatures associated with 11 out of the 13 drug repurposing candidates identified in the original Sano GOLD study were reproduced in this study These results demonstrate the reproducibility of long COVID disease signal found by combinatorial analysis broadly validating the results of the original analysis They provide compelling evidence for a much broader array of genetic associations with long COVID than previously identified through traditional GWAS studies This strongly supports the hypothesis that genetic factors play a critical role in determining an individuals susceptibility to long COVID following recovery from acute SARSCoV2 infection It also lends weight to the drug repurposing candidates identified in the original analysis Together these results may help to stimulate much needed new precision medicine approaches to more effectively diagnose and treat the disease This is also the first reproduction of long COVID genetic associations across multiple populations with substantially different ancestry distributions Given the high reproducibility rate across diverse populations these findings may have broader clinical application and promote better health equity We hope that this will provide confidence to explore some of these mechanisms and drug targets and help advance research into novel ways to diagnose the disease and accelerate the discovery and selection of better therapeutic options both in the form of newly discovered drugs andor the immediate prioritization of coordinated investigations into the efficacy of repurposed drug candidates,Journal of translational
