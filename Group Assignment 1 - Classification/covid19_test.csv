39376591,Genetic diversity and genomic epidemiology of SARSCoV2 during the first 3 years of the pandemic in Morocco comprehensive sequence analysis including the unique lineage B1528 in Morocco,During the 3 years following the emergence of the COVID19 pandemic the African continent like other regions of the world was substantially impacted by COVID19 In Morocco the COVID19 pandemic has been marked by the emergence and spread of several SARSCoV2 variants leading to a substantial increase in the incidence of infections and deaths Nevertheless the comprehensive understanding of the genetic diversity evolution and epidemiology of several viral lineages remained limited in Morocco This study sought to deepen the understanding of the genomic epidemiology of SARSCoV2 through a retrospective analysis The main objective of this study was to analyse the genetic diversity of SARSCoV2 and identify distinct lineages as well as assess their evolution during the pandemic in Morocco using genomic epidemiology approaches Furthermore several key mutations in the functional proteins across different viral lineages were highlighted along with an analysis of the genetic relationships amongst these strains to better understand their evolutionary pathways A total of 2274 genomic sequences of SARSCoV2 isolated in Morocco during the period of 2020 to 2023 were extracted from the GISAID EpiCoV database and subjected to analysis Lineages and clades were classified according to the nomenclature of GISAID Nextstrain and Pangolin The study was conducted and reported in accordance with STROBE Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology guidelines An exhaustive analysis of 2274 genomic sequences led to the identification of 157 PANGO lineages including notable lineages such as B1 B11 B1528 and B1177 as well as variants such as B117 B1621 B1525 B1351 B16171 B16172 and its notable sublineages AY33 AY72 AY112 AY121 that evolved over time before being supplanted by Omicron in December 2021 Among the 2274 sequences analysed Omicron and its subvariants had a prevalence of 595 The most predominant clades were 21K 21L and 22B which are respectively related phylogenetically to BA1 BA2 and BA5 In June 2022 Morocco rapidly observed a recrudescence of cases of infection with the emergence and concurrent coexistence of subvariants from clade 22B such as BA5220 BA5 BA51 BA521 and BF5 supplanting the subvariants BA1 clade display 21K and BA2 clade display 21L which became marginal However XBB clade 22F and its progeny such XBB1523A XBB11623B CH1123C XBB1923D XBB2323E EG5123F and XBB157023G have evolved sporadically Furthermore several notable mutations such as H69delV70del G142D K417N T478K E484K E484A L452R F486P N501Y Q613H D614G and P681HR have been identified Some of these SARSCoV2 mutations are known to be involved in increasing transmissibility virulence and antibody escape This study has identified several distinct lineages and mutations involved in the genetic diversity of Moroccan isolates as well as the analysis of their evolutionary trends These findings provide a robust basis for better understanding the distinct mutations and their roles in the variation of transmissibility pathogenicity and antigenicity immune evasionreinfection Furthermore the noteworthy number of distinct lineages identified in Morocco

40310264,Genomicsbased approach for detection and characterization of SARSCoV2 coinfections and diverse viral populations,Due to the continuous genetic diversification of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus type 2 SARSCoV2 over time the cocirculation of two different lineages in the same region may lead to coinfections within a host a situation known to contribute to the emergence of hybrid viral populations through genomic recombination The aim of this study was to use a genomicsbased approach to identify distinct viral populations of SARSCoV2 in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 COVID19 as an indicator of potential coinfections and recombination events The cohort included 41224 serial nasopharyngeal swabs positive for SARSCoV2 RNA prospectively collected between January 2021 and April 2022 as part of the French national surveillance program Fulllength genomes were sequenced by nextgeneration sequencing COVIDseq Intrahost single nucleotide variants iSNVs were identified and a synthetic cohort was generated to establish thresholds of coinfection detection Eight hundred sixtyone samples with iSNV ratios above the threshold were considered potential coinfections Peaks in coinfection prevalence occurred during the periods of cocirculation of different SARSCoV2 variants Coinfection with different Variants of Concern VoC was confirmed in 103 cases including AlphaBeta in 12 cases AlphaDelta in 15 cases GammaDelta in 4 cases DeltaOmicron in 35 cases and Omicron BA1BA2 in 37 cases In conclusion our study suggests a higher prevalence of SARSCoV2 variantsubvariant coinfection events than that previously reported using conventional approaches particularly during periods characterized by the emergence and cocirculation of multiple lineages creating an increased risk of recombination Our results support the premise of the importance of genomicsbased approaches to detect coinfection events in virusinfected populations including coinfection with closely related lineages We aim to implement an innovative approach to monitor and study the diversity of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus type 2 SARSCoV2 within the human population particularly during periods of emergence and circulation of VOCs This approach focused on detecting highly diverse viral samples and coinfection cases which are known to facilitate viral diversity through recombination and can potentially lead to the emergence of new recombinant lineages with novel characteristics Monitoring and characterizing coinfection cases during an outbreak is a key strategy for better understanding viral evolution especially during epidemic periods However detecting coinfection cases is challenging and their prevalence is often highly underestimated In this study we developed a strategy to identify highly diverse viral samples that can be implemented in surveillance programs and applied to large datasets We aim to implement an innovative approach to monitor and study the diversity of SARSCoV2 within the human population particularly during periods of emergence and circulation of Variants of Concern This approach focused on

40381379,Estimating population immunity to SARSCoV2 by random sampling from primary and secondary healthcare in Scotland May 2024,As the COVID19 pandemic has ended the global focus has shifted from pandemic response to longterm management With no ongoing nationwide serosurveillance studies our understanding of the level of immunity in the general population has diminished In this study we screened random samples from a biorepository serving the largest health board in Scotland for antibodies against SARSCoV2 to define the current immunological landscape informing vaccine strategies going forward 997 pseudonymized serum samples were obtained from NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde NHS GGC biorepository in May 2024 along with associated data for age sex and COVID19 vaccine history Samples spanned ages from 19 to 98 years with 590 female and 410 male and 391 from primary healthcare GP practices and 610 from secondary healthcare hospitals AntiSARSCoV2 receptor binding domain RBDspecific antibodies were measured by enzymelinked immunosorbent assay ELISA while neutralising antibodies were quantified using HIVSARSCoV2 pseudotypebased virus neutralisation assay PVNA ELISAs measured both total IgG and IgG4mediated responses Pseudotypes were prepared bearing spike proteins from vaccine antigens B1 and XBB15 contemporaneous circulating variants KP311 and LB1 and the emerging variant XEC Samples were grouped by number of COVID19 vaccine doses received from no vaccination to 8 doses and 12 samples from each group were screened by ELISA and PVNA The random selection of 1000 samples provided a broad crosssection of the population derived from patients with a range of individual vaccine histories from those having received no COVID19 vaccines to those having received 8 or more doses The number of doses received increased with age from a mean age of 40 for those having received one dose to a mean age of 7778 for those having received 7 or 8 doses While total IgG responses were similar across each of the groups irrespective of vaccine history repeated exposure to mRNAbased vaccines elicited an increase in SARSCoV2specific IgG4 Neutralising antibody titres against the vaccine antigens B1 and XBB15 increased with age reaching maximum geometric mean titres of 5610 95 CI 277311349 for B1 and 4577 183211440 for XBB15 in those receiving 8 doses In all groups titres measured against the KP311 LB1 and XEC were significantly lower consistent with the emergence of immune evasive variants over time Crossneutralisation of KP311 was limited to maxima of

fatigue and cognitive and functional impairment The etiology and management of MECFS remain contentious and patients often describe their experiences through social media We explored public discourse on Twitter rebranded as X to understand the concerns and priorities of individuals living with MECFS with a focus on 1 the COVID19 pandemic and 2 publication of the 2021 UK National Institute for Health and Care Excellence NICE guidelines on the diagnosis and management of MECFS We used the Twitter application programming interface to collect tweets related to MECFS posted between January 1 2010 and January 30 2024 Tweets were sorted into 3 chronological periods preCOVID19 pandemic postCOVID19 pandemic and postUK 2021 NICE Guidelines publication A Robustly Optimized Bidirectional Embedding Representations from Transformers Pretraining Approach RoBERTa language processing model was used to categorize the sentiment of tweets as positive negative or neutral We identified tweets that mentioned COVID19 the UK NICE guidelines and key themes identified through latent Dirichlet allocation ie fibromyalgia research and treatment We sampled 1000 random tweets from each theme to identify subthemes and representative quotes We retrieved 906404 tweets of which 427824 472 were neutral 369371 4075 were negative and 109209 1205 were positive Over time both the proportion of negative and positive tweets increased and the proportion of neutral tweets decreased P001 for all changes Tweets mentioning fibromyalgia acknowledged similarities with MECFS stigmatization associated with both disorders and lack of effective treatments Treatmentrelated tweets often described frustration with MECFS labeled as mental illness dismissal of concerns by health care providers and the need to seek out good physicians who viewed MECFS as a physical disorder Tweets on research typically praised studies of biomarkers and biomedical therapies called for greater investment in biomedical research and expressed frustration with studies suggesting a biopsychosocial etiology for MECFS or supporting management with psychotherapy or graduated activity Tweets about the UK NICE guidelines expressed frustration with the 2007 version that recommended cognitive behavioral therapy and graded exercise therapy and a prolonged campaign by advocacy organizations to influence subsequent versions Tweets showed high acceptance of the 2021 UK NICE guidelines which were seen to validate MECFS as a biomedical disease and recommended against graded exercise therapy Tweets about COVID19 often noted overlaps between postCOVID19 condition and MECFS including claims of a common biological pathway and advised there was no cure for either condition Our findings suggest research is needed

individuals The first aim is to compare Hispanic and nonHispanic participants in terms of their preferences for COVID19 vaccinerelated social media pages in which the ethnicity of individuals shown in the images Hispanic vs nonHispanic and the language in the text Spanish vs English vary The second aim is to identify which combination of ethnic imagery and language in the text is most preferred among Hispanic participants when seeking COVID19 vaccination information A total of 936 participants Hispanic n448 nonHispanic n488 were included in the study We created experimental social media group pages modeled after Facebook groups in which the ethnicity of individuals shown in the imagery and the language used in the text were manipulated A total of 4 conditions were developed 1 Hispanic imagery with Spanish text 2 nonHispanic imagery with Spanish text 3 Hispanic imagery with English text and 4 nonHispanic imagery with English text Participants were asked to indicate the extent to which they would be willing to seek help from each social media group page under the assumption that they were looking for information or assistance related to the COVID19 vaccine regardless of their actual vaccination status A betweensubjects ANOVA and a oneway repeatedmeasures ANOVA were conducted to analyze the data The findings indicated that Hispanic participants significantly preferred social media pages featuring Hispanic imagery and Spanish text compared to nonHispanic participants Moreover a page with nonHispanic imagery and English text was less preferred by Hispanic than by nonHispanic individuals Among Hispanic participants the condition featuring Hispanic imagery and Spanish text emerged as the most favored particularly when compared to conditions featuring nonHispanic imagery paired with either Spanish or English text Notably there was no significant difference between the preference for the condition with Hispanic imagery and Spanish text and the condition with Hispanic imagery and English text suggesting that imagery may have a stronger influence than language in shaping preferences These results suggest that incorporating ethnic and language
